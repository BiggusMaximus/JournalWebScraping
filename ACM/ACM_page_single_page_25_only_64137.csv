Computer-aided cluster formation in wireless sensor networks using machine learning,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.3233/JIFS-223242,0,research-article,ACM,2023,"There is a widespread use of cluster-based routing in wireless sensor networks since it is the most energy-efficient. Idealizing cluster heads, on the other hand, is NP-hard and hence requires heuristic or metaheuristic approaches. However, while outperforming algorithms, metaheuristics computation time restricts its ability to respond to routing requests as rapidly as algorithms can today. A network’s or an application’s parameters can’t be easily accommodated by routing methods. This paper offers the HMML, a combination model combining hybrid metaheuristics and machine-learning. Our HMML model makes use of an automated tuning metaheuristic (e.g. evolutionary algorithm) to fine-tune the heuristic technique for each specific configuration. For a variety of combinations, this is done. A network simulation is run using the modified heuristic algorithm in each configuration to arrive at a solution. As a result, a comprehensive dataset for a variety of conditions is produced (e.g., support vector machine). These characteristics include local (round-state), global (network-state), and application-specific aspects of the input feature vector. After training, the HMML model may be used to quickly cluster data. Machine learning’s capacity to generalize helps us comprehend the metaheuristic algorithm’s behavior in identifying optimal paths for previous configurations. Simulation studies show that HMML can adapt to varied applications while extending network life which increases upto 5% for total energy consumption.",none
Review: Classical and swarm intelligence based routing protocols for wireless sensor networks: A survey and comparison,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.jnca.2012.03.004,49,article,ACM,2012,"High efficient routing is an important issue for the design of wireless sensor network (WSN) protocols to meet the severe hardware and resource constraints. This paper presents a comprehensive survey and comparison of routing protocols in WSNs. The first part of the paper surveys state-of-the-art routing protocols in WSNs from classical routing protocols to swarm intelligence based protocols. The routing protocols are categorized based on their computational complexity, network structure, energy efficiency and path establishment. The second part of the paper presents a comparison of a representative number of classical and swarm based protocols. Comparing routing protocols in WSNs is currently a very challenging task for protocol designers. Often, much time is required to re-create and re-simulate algorithms from descriptions in published papers to perform the comparison. Compounding the difficulty is that some simulation parameters and performance metrics may not be mentioned. We see a need in the research community to have standard simulation and performance metrics for comparing different protocols. To this end, the final part of the paper re-simulates different protocols using a Matlab based simulator: routing modeling application simulation environment (RMASE), and gives simulation results for standard simulation and performance metrics which we hope will serve as a benchmark for future comparisons for the research community.",none
Collaborative WSN-UAV Data Collection in Smart Agriculture: A Bi-objective Optimization Scheme,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3597025,1,research-article,ACM,2023,"Smart agriculture which integrates the agriculture with Internet of Things (IoT) has attracted attention since it contributes to increase the productivity and quality of crops, reduce energy consumption and facilitate the farmers. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are two most commonly deployed devices that are used for enabling the smart agriculture. In this paper, we design a collaborative WSN-UAV system, wherein different clusters of sensor nodes form different sensor-based virtual antenna arrays (SVAAs) to transmit the collected data towards different receiver UAVs via adopting collaborative beamforming (CB), then the receiver UAVs will take the collected data back to the ground control station (GCS). We formulate a transmission rate and battery energy bi-objective optimization problem (TRBEBOP) to simultaneously maximize the total transmission rate of the sensor-based CB clusters and the total remaining battery energy of the selected sensor nodes, by selecting appropriate sensor nodes in each cluster that can form a predominant SVAA, determining suitable receiver UAVs and optimizing the excitation current weights of the selected sensor nodes. To handle the formulated TRBEBOP that is demonstrated to be non-convex and NP-hard, an enhanced non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (ENSGA-II) with several specific designs is presented. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed ENSGA-II for solving the formulated TRBEBOP. Moreover, compared with other benchmark algorithms, the superiority of the proposed ENSGA-II is demonstrated. In addition, the impacts of several fortuitous circumstances on the system are estimated, and the results illustrate the robustness of the proposed scheme. Finally, the discussion about several mechanisms to deal with the interference induced by the sidelobe levels and the impact of UAV movement on receiving rate are provided.",none
Effective fault detection and routing scheme for wireless sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.compeleceng.2013.04.027,21,research-article,ACM,2014,"Display Omitted An energy efficient fault detection and data routing scheme (EFDR) is proposed for sensor nodes hardware.Cellular automata (CA) rules have been employed for sensor node and network management.The proposed scheme reuses the faulty sensor nodes in order to improve the network performances.The proposed method uses vector based fault detection model for sensor circuit fault identification.The performance of the EFDR is better in terms of network coverage, network life time and energy consumption. In a wireless sensor network (WSN), random occurrences of faulty nodes degrade the quality of service of the network. In this paper, we propose an efficient fault detection and routing (EFDR) scheme to manage a large size WSN. The faulty nodes are detected by neighbour node's temporal and spatial correlation of sensing information and heart beat message passed by the cluster head. In EFDR scheme, three linear cellular automata (CA) are used to manage transmitter circuit/ battery condition/microcontroller fault, receiver circuit fault and sensor circuit fault representation. On the other hand, L-system rules based data routing scheme is proposed to determine optimal routing path between cluster head and base station. The proposed EFDR technique is capable of detecting and managing the faulty nodes in an efficient manner.

AI-Enabled Ant-Routing Protocol to Secure Communication in Flying Networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1155/2022/3330168,0,research-article,ACM,2022,"Artificial intelligence has recently been used in FANET-based routing strategies for decision-making, which is a unique paradigm.

Parameter estimation in wireless sensor networks with faulty transducers,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.sigpro.2017.10.012,0,research-article,ACM,2018,"A diffusion-averaging distributed Expectation-Maximization algorithm is proposed.It estimates a parameter vector with a wireless sensor network with faulty nodes.Only local information exchange among nodes, which may be faulty, is required.A vanishing step-size is used to switch from a diffusion stage to an averaging one.Stable points of the centralized solution are convergent for the proposed method. We address the problem of distributed estimation of a vector-valued parameter performed by a wireless sensor network in the presence of noisy observations which may be unreliable due to faulty transducers. The proposed distributed estimator is based on the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm and combines consensus and diffusion techniques: a term for information diffusion is gradually turned off, while a term for updated information averaging is turned on so that all nodes in the network approach the same value of the estimate. The proposed method requires only local exchanges of information among network nodes and, in contrast with previous approaches, it does not assume knowledge of the a priori probability of transducer failures or the noise variance. A convergence analysis is provided, showing that the convergent points of the centralized EM iteration are locally asymptotically convergent points of the proposed distributed scheme. Numerical examples show that the distributed algorithm asymptotically attains the performance of the centralized EM method.",none
A learning-based approach to improving multicast network performance,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1504/ijcnds.2023.133901,0,research-article,ACM,2023,"A neural network approach is recommended by us in this research paper, to solve the problem of multicast routing subject to some quality of service (QoS) restrictions in communications and internet of things (IoT) networks, which is considered a complete nondeterministic polynomial (NP) problem.

Software-Defined Networking in wireless ad hoc scenarios: Objectives and control architectures,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.jnca.2022.103387,1,review-article,ACM,2022,"While SDN has traditionally targeted fixed and wired environments with hundreds of nodes, recently its main principles have also been followed in wireless ad hoc scenarios. However, node mobility and heterogeneity characterizing such dynamic scenarios prevent the adoption of purely centralized control solutions, pushing for more articulated and distributed architectures. We provide a thorough analysis of state-of-the-art literature related to the adoption of SDN in wireless ad hoc scenarios, ranging from WSNs with mostly fixed sensors and WMNs with mobile clients but stable routers to MANETs with every node freely moving on the field, VANETs with vehicles speeding through the network road, and FANETs with aerial vehicles flying in every direction. For each identified wireless ad hoc scenario, we present the rationale behind the adoption of SDN, recognizing that the objective of the SDN controller is far beyond mere routing management in such challenging scenarios. Furthermore, we detail the proposed control architectures, showing how the peculiar characteristics (and related goals) of a given scenario influence the architecture design.

Approximation and polynomial algorithms for the data mule scheduling with handling time and time span constraints,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.ipl.2022.106299,1,rapid-communication,ACM,2022,"ts•The first constant factor approximation algorithm for the DMSTC on a tree.•Polynomial algorithms for uniform DMSTC on a spider with fixed number of branches.•Polynomial time algorithm for uniform DMSTC on a cycle.AbstractIn this paper, we address the data mule scheduling problem with time constraints (DMSTC) in which the aim is to dispatch from a depot the minimum number of data mules to serve target sensors located on a network. Each target sensor is associated with a handling time and each dispatched data mule must return to the depot before time span D. Our main contribution is as follows. First, we give the first constant-factor 2-approximation algorithm and a bicriteria polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) for the DMSTC defined on a tree. The former result resolves an open problem proposed in the literature (Chen et al., 2020 [4]). This is achieved by an approximation preserving reduction from the DMSTC to the distance constrained vehicle routing problem, i.e. a special case of the DMSTC with zero handling times. Second, we show that our approximation preserving reduction can be extended to the multi-depot version of the DMSTC and derive a similar bicriteria PTAS for the multi-depot DMSTC on a tree if the number of depots is a fixed constant. Finally, we consider the uniform DMSTC, which is a particular case of the DMSTC with all handling times identical, and develop the first non-trivial polynomial algorithms for the uniform DMSTC define on several classes of special networks, including spiders, paths and cycles.",none
A fuzzy based Q – learning approach to prevent sinkhole attacks in MANET (FQ – SPM),https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.3233/JIFS-232003,0,research-article,ACM,2024,"Mobile Ad-Hoc Networks (MANET) are considered one of the significant and growing areas in today’s scenario of technological advancement. It is an infrastructure-less and dynamic ad-hoc network that requires a connection between nodes to deliver packets and data. However, its design adopts a connection-less approach, at the helm of which no monitoring node exists. Hence, the threat of maintaining the network’s security remains an uphill task. Many attacks have been attempted to breach the protection of the MANET. This paper discusses one of the most potent attacks in a MANET infrastructure, the Sinkhole Attack. We try to minimize the possibility of a sinkhole attack using a Fuzzy Q-learning-based approach, a reinforcement learning technique. The results are encouraging, suggesting that sinkhole attacks can be minimized to a great extent after the adaption of the proposed approach.",none
Simultaneous optimization of cluster head selection and inter-cluster routing in wireless sensor networks using a 2-level genetic algorithm,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.asoc.2022.109444,1,research-article,ACM,2022,"In cluster-based sensor networks, at each cluster, sensor nodes send the collected data to a cluster head which aggregates and forwards them to a sink node. Data transmission from a cluster head to the sink node can be done in a multi-hop fashion through other cluster heads. Hence, two problems need to be addressed in this regard: Selection of cluster heads, and optimal multi-hop routing. In previous studies, these two problems have been solved separately in two independent phases. This paper proposes a novel approach to solve them simultaneously in order to increase the network lifetime. In the proposed scheme, the cluster head’s role in transmitting the inter-cluster traffic is considered during the cluster head selection process. In other words, cluster heads are selected in a way which reduces the energy consumption for transmitting data from a cluster head to the sink node. To achieve this goal, the genetic algorithm is used in two levels. The first-level genetic algorithm selects the cluster heads while the second-level one considers multi-hop routing among them. Simulation of the proposed method and comparison of its results with three previously proposed schemes which solve the problems separately indicate the superiority of the proposed optimization scheme in improving the lifetime of the network.",none

The specific objective is to establish an optimal nature-inspired algorithm and comparing it with other algorithms regarding the capacity to achieve manufacturing optimization in large WSNs, especially in relation to the parameters of high scalability, data delivery rate, and low-energy consumption. Also, the study seeks to determine the extent to which swarm intelligence (SI)-based centralized clustering solutions (optimal nature-inspired algorithms), compared to other approaches, might optimize the WSN features of localization and network coverage. To determine the solutions’ performance, the study involved three scenarios. In scenario 1, the network operational time and the stability of SI-based algorithms were investigated for large WSNs that had the minimum heterogeneity. Imperative to note is that the WSNs on focus had different numbers of nodes, which included 500, 300, and 100. In scenario 2, the motivation was to investigate the SI-based WSN protocols in relation to the parameters of packet delivery, energy conception, and network lifetime for large WSNs.

Survey on computation offloading in UAV-Enabled mobile edge computing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.jnca.2022.103341,18,review-article,ACM,2022,"With the increasing growth of internet-of-things (IoT) devices, effective computation performance has become a critical issue. Many services provided by IoT devices (e.g., augmented reality, location-tracking, traffic systems, and autonomous driving) require intensive real-time data processing, which demands powerful computational resources.

While V2X communication stands as a cornerstone for ITS, enabling enhanced safety, efficiency, and automation in vehicular environments, it necessitates sophisticated RA strategies to address the dynamic and diverse demands of modern networks. As vehicle numbers grow, there is a rising need for more spectral resources to ensure efficient and dependable services. In areas with high vehicle concentrations, the demand for these resources intensifies to maintain swift, stable connectivity. Due to limited power, channel, and spectrum resources, their allocation is a critical challenge in V2X network. Efficient allocation of these resources is vital to prevent interference and ensure smooth communication. This study categorizes RA methods into graph-based, game theory-based, genetic algorithm-based, heuristic-based, optimization technique-based, machine learning-based, deep learning-based, and reinforcement learning-based approaches, each with its unique advantages and applicability in V2X contexts. We further delineate the evaluation metrics critical for assessing these methods, including throughput, latency, reliability, and energy efficiency, to provide a comprehensive context for comparison.

Node clustering and data aggregation in wireless sensor network using sailfish optimization,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11042-023-15225-z,0,research-article,ACM,2023,"Wireless sensor networks (WSN) are an assortment of sensor nodes that are used in multiple fields. Wireless sensor networks, often known as WSNs, have garnered much interest recently owing to their limitless potential. Because the WSN field is barely ten years old and WSN has typical characteristics and constraints, there are many problems associated with WSN that need to be studied, analyzed, and solved as well as many challenges that need to be met for its widespread use and easy acceptance by users. These problems and challenges can be attributed to WSNs having typical characteristics and constraints. The growth of WSN technology is limited by lifetime issues. A major portion of power is wasted by forwarding redundant data from the sensor nodes (SN) to the base station (BS). So, a specific and accurate data aggregation technique is needed for successful WSN use. In this work, two major contributions are proposed. Initially, Sail Fish Optimization (SFO) based on cluster head selection algorithm was introduced for clustering. Then, an improved SVM classification algorithm was proposed for data aggregation. The hyperparameters of SVM are adjusted by using Sailfish Optimization. Sailfish Optimization is one of the many nature-inspired optimization techniques. It is based on the hunting nature of sailfish in oceans. In comparison to existing algorithms, the proposed algorithm’s performance is measured in terms of delay, energy, packet delivery ratio, and data classification accuracy compared to other algorithms. The proposed work achieves the overhead with minimal value of 5.56% compared to existing methods.",none

Energy-efficient and delay-guaranteed routing algorithm for software-defined wireless sensor networks: A cooperative deep reinforcement learning approach,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.jnca.2023.103674,0,research-article,ACM,2023,"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have undergone rapid development but still suffer from energy shortage issues. Meanwhile, existing energy-efficient routing approaches lack a cross-layer cooperation mechanism and cannot offer intelligent decision-making capabilities for resource-constrained nodes. In this paper, we design an intelligent routing algorithm with adaptive duty cycling for application in software-defined WSNs (SDWSNs) to maximize the network lifetime and data transmission reliability subject to a long-term data queue stability constraint. In particular, we introduce Lyapunov optimization to decouple the multistage routing optimization problem into per-frame deterministic problems with delay guarantee. To optimize the routing algorithm and adaptively adjust the duty-cycling mechanism, we propose a cooperative deep reinforcement learning (CDRL) model. Moreover, we develop a centralized training and distributed execution framework to decouple the model training and inference processes, which provides the capability of intelligent routing decision-making for resource-constrained nodes with low computational complexity. In addition, we design a new hybrid routing metric and a unique feature construction and extraction scheme to capture fine-grained information from our hybrid routing metric. The proposed CDRL algorithm adopts a cooperative and iterative model optimization strategy to achieve highly reliable data transmission and optimal long-term network performance. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in terms of network lifetime, packet delivery ratio, and statistical delay performance under various scenarios compared to the EBR-RL, EA-AGG, and QLRP algorithms.",none

Simultaneously, energy consumption for processing the tasks in most of the applications has also been increased. The nodes in the network may die while utilizing more energy for executing the tasks. The death of nodes causes various issues in data transmission. In most cases, the nodes next to the sink may have more traffic and it makes the energy to drain quickly.

However, energy efficiency is a major issue in WSNs. The sensor nodes typically have limited energy but the energy consumption exceeds during data transmission. An energy efficient cluster based routing protocol reduces the transmission distance among the base station (BS) and the sensor nodes in terms of organizing the nodes in the form of clusters and evade the nodes with lower energy. Therefore, energy efficient Ultra-Scalable Ensemble Clustering technique is introduced in this work to cluster the nodes for handling large data. Then, the Flamingo Search Algorithm is employed for cluster head (CH) selection due to its less computational complexity and high stability. Finally, Q-Learning approach is adopted to select the shortest path between CHs and BS as it is capable of path selection at complex network conditions. The reward points in this approach are generated based on the objective function that considers the distance among the CH and BS, coverage area and energy consumption. Experiments are evaluated and analyzed with existing approaches in terms of alive nodes, time consumption, rounds for last node dead, first node dead, half node dead, throughput and total residual energy. The consequences prove that the offered technique can enhance the energy efficiency of WSN compared to similar existing approaches.",none
Enhanced reinforcement learning assisted dynamic power management model for internet‐of‐things centric wireless sensor network,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1049/iet-com.2020.0026,2,research-article,ACM,2021,"The exponential rise in the demands of the wireless communication system has alarmed industries to achieve more efficient and quality‐of‐service (QoS) centric wireless communication networks. The decentralised and infrastructure‐less nature of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) enable it to be one of the most sought and used wireless network globally. Its cost‐efficiency and functional robustness towards low‐power lossy networks make it suitable for internet‐of‐things (IoT) applications. In recent years, IoT technologies have been used in diverse applications, including Smart City Planning and Management (SCPM). Although, mobile‐WSN has played a decisive role in IoT enabled SCPM, its routing optimality and power transmission have always remained challenging. Noticeably, major existing researches address mainly on routing optimisation and very few efforts are made towards dynamic power management (DPM) under non‐linear network conditions. With this motive, in this study, a highly robust and efficient QoS – centric reinforcement learning‐based DPM model has been developed for mobile‐WSN to be used in SCPM. Unlike classical reinforcement learning methods, the authors’ proposed advanced reinforcement learning‐based DPM model exploits both known and unknown network parameters and state‐activity values, including bit‐error probability, channel state information, holding time, buffer cost etc. to perform dynamic switching decision. The key objective of the proposed model is to ensure optimal QoS oriented DPM and adaptive switching control to yield reliable transmission with the maximum possible resource utilisation.

A distributed reinforcement learning based sensor node scheduling algorithm for coverage and connectivity maintenance in wireless sensor network,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11276-020-02350-y,12,research-article,ACM,2020,"The fundamental challenge for randomly deployed resource-constrained wireless sensor network is to enhance the network lifetime without compromising its performance metrics such as coverage rate and network connectivity. One way is to schedule the activities of sensor nodes and form scheduling rounds autonomously in such a way that each spatial point is covered by at least one sensor node and there must be at least one communication path from the sensor nodes to base station. This autonomous activity scheduling of the sensor nodes can be efficiently done with Reinforcement Learning (RL), a technique of machine learning because it does not require prior environment modeling. In this paper, a Nash Q-Learning based node scheduling algorithm for coverage and connectivity maintenance (CCM-RL) is proposed where each node autonomously learns its optimal action (active/hibernate/sleep/customize the sensing range) to maximize the coverage rate and maintain network connectivity. The learning algorithm resides inside each sensor node. The main objective of this algorithm is to enable the sensor nodes to learn their optimal action so that the total number of activated nodes in each scheduling round becomes minimum and preserves the criteria of coverage rate and network connectivity. The comparison of CCM-RL protocol with other protocols proves its accuracy and reliability. The simulative comparison shows that CCM-RL performs better in terms of an average number of active sensor nodes in one scheduling round, coverage rate, and energy consumption.",none
An improved cluster formation process in wireless sensor network to decrease energy consumption,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11276-020-02485-y,3,research-article,ACM,2021,"Wireless sensor network has special features and many applications, which have attracted attention of many scientists. High energy consumption of these networks, as a drawback, can be reduced by a hierarchical routing algorithm. The proposed algorithm is based on the Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) and Quadrant Cluster based LEACH (Q-LEACH) protocols. To reduce energy consumption and provide a more appropriate coverage, the network was divided into several regions and clusters were formed within each region. In selecting the cluster head (CH) in each round, the amount of residual energy and the distance from the center of each node were calculated by the base station (including the location and residual energy of each node) for all living nodes in each region. In this regard, the node with the largest value had the highest priority to be selected as the CH in each network region. The base station calculates the CH due to the lack of energy constraints and is also responsible for informing it throughout the network, which reduces the load consumption and tasks of nodes in the network. The information transfer steps in this protocol are similar to the LEACH protocol stages. To better evaluate the results, the proposed method was implemented with LEACH LEACH-SWDN, and Q-LEACH protocols using MATLAB software. The results showed better performance of the proposed method in network lifetime, first node death time, and the last node death time.",none
Particle-Water Wave Optimization for Secure Routing in Wireless Sensor Network Using Cluster Head Selection,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11277-021-08335-0,5,research-article,ACM,2021,"Wireless sensor network (WSN) has some great advantages, such as flexible communication, low power consumption, and low cost. In view of the WSN clustering algorithm, the dynamic cluster head selection methods are put forward in order to solve the problem of the unreasonable cluster head selection that may lead to the overlapping coverage and unbalanced energy consumption in the cluster communication. Also, security is an important aspect in the WSN. Various security and routing protocols are developed for increasing the efficiency of packet transmission, but discovering the optimal path without degrading transmission reliability poses a challenging task in the sensor network. Hence, an effective and optimal secure routing algorithm named Particle-Water Wave Optimization (P-WWO) is developed in this research for routing the data packets in secure path. The proposed P-WWO algorithm is designed by integrating the Particle Swam Optimization (PSO) with the Water Wave Optimization (WWO). The secure route needed to broadcast the data packets is determined through the selection of Cluster Head using the PSO-based cellular automata with fitness measure. However, the fitness measure is computed by considering the factors, like energy, delay, trust, consistency factor, and maintainability factor. Accordingly, the routing path with the minimal distance and less delay is accepted as the optimal path using the proposed P-WWO based on the fitness value. The route maintenance process enables the proposed optimization to decide whether the packets can be transmitted in the selected route or need to re-route the data. Moreover, the proposed P-WWO obtained better performance using the metrics, such as energy balancing index, coverage, number of alive-nodes, and average energy left with the values of 0.9246 99.9%, 144, and 0.666 J, respectively.",none

A signal reconstruction method of wireless sensor network based on compressed sensing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1186/s13638-020-01724-2,1,research-article,ACM,2020,"Compressed sensing (CS) is a new theory for sampling and recovering signal-based sparse transformation. This theory could help us to acquire complete signal at low cost. Therefore, it also satisfies the requirement of low-cost sampling since bandwidth and capability of sampling is not sufficient. However, wireless sensor network is an open scene, and signal is easily affected by noise in the open environment. Specially, CS theory indicates a method of sub-Nyquist sampling which is effective to reduce cost in the process of data acquirement. However, the sampling is “imperfect”, and the corresponding data is more sensitive to noise. Consequently, it is urgently requisited for robust and antinoise reconstruction algorithms which can ensure the accuracy of signal reconstruction. In the article, we present a proximal gradient algorithm (PRG) to reconstruct sub-Nyquist sampling signal in the noise environment. This algorithm iteratively uses a straightforward shrinkage step to find the optimum solution of constrained formula, and then restores the original signal.

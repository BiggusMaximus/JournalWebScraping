Corona based node distribution scheme targeting energy balancing in wireless sensor networks for the sensors having limited sensing range,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11276-018-1834-9,4,research-article,ACM,2020,"Wireless sensor networks are equipped with sensor nodes having limited battery as energy source. These sensor nodes have to maintain the desirable coverage of the network to ensure the periodical communication of the sensed data to the base station. Therefore, lifetime of sensor nodes and the energy efficient network coverage are the two major issues that needs to be addressed. Effective placement of wireless sensor nodes is of paramount importance as the lifetime of the network depends upon it. In this work, a corona based energy balanced node deployment scheme for sensors with a limited sensing range is proposed in which the nodes are distributed in accordance with a probability density function (PDF). Optimal number of nodes in each corona is determined using the proposed PDF. Performance of the scheme is evaluated in terms of coverage, energy balance and network lifetime through simulation. The intrinsic characteristic of the proposed PDF has been derived. It is noticed that the node distribution through the proposed scheme not only provides better coverage in each layer but also minimizes both the energy-hole and the coverage-hole problems in the deployment field while maintaining longevity of the sensor network.",none
"Routing Protocols in Wireless Body Area Networks: Architecture, Challenges, and Classification",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1155/2023/9229297,2,review-article,ACM,2023,"The wireless body area network (WBAN) is a branch of the wireless sensor network (WSN) intended for tracking essential patients’ physiological signals and transferring this knowledge to the coordinator. During the routing of data, WBANs encounter critical routing problems like WSNs. Moreover, the particular constraints of WBANs make it more challenging that they need to be addressed. This survey article categorizes and briefly analyzes a range of current routing methods utilized in WBANs. The routing protocol is essential to the creation of any efficient and reliable wireless body area network due to a limited size of battery in the body sensor nodes. A comparison study of numerous routing protocols has been made in this paper, which is helpful in selecting the optimal routing protocol for the application being targeted. The article describes the WBAN architecture and addresses numerous challenges in the context of successful WBAN routing. In this paper, several existing WBAN routing methods are presented which are influenced by network structure, energy, quality of service (QoS), node temperature, human position, node transmission range, and other factors. The protocols, including cross-layered, cluster-based, QoS-aware, postural movement-based, temperature-aware, postural movement-based, and routing protocols, are given in an expressive taxonomy. Different routing protocols that have already been developed for WBANs are compared with more advanced protocols. The pros and cons of each protocol are looked at based on factors like delay, packet delivery ratio, and energy use.

DBlock-RLB: An energy efficient framework for intelligent routing and trading based load balancing in SDWSN environment,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.adhoc.2024.103475,0,research-article,ACM,2024,"Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is an emerging field that enables them to work in complex scenarios with enough flexibility. The WSN systems are improved in terms of network flexibility by integrating Software Defined Network (SDN) to obtain SDWSN environment. However, security and energy efficiency are the major issues in the SDWSN environment which leads to low network lifetime. To resolve the existing issues, we proposed DAG-based BLOCKchain-Routing and Load Balancing Model (DBLOCK-RLB). The proposed approach performs routing and load balancing in the SDWSN environment in an energy efficient manner with high security. The SDWSN environment is composed of four major planes as data plane, switch plane, control plane, and application plane. The sensor nodes in the data plane are authenticated priory to ensure legitimacy and reduce unwanted network traffics by adopting Camellia Encryption Algorithm (CAE) which provides secret key to the user by considering several metrics. The authenticated sensor nodes are clustered to reduce energy consumption using Adaptive Threshold based Network Partitioning in which the circular SDWSN environment is split into equal parts and optimal Cluster Head selection is done by considering clustering metrics. From the clustered network, the CH is responsible for intelligent routing. For intelligent routing, we utilize Dual Agent-Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DA-TD3) in which one agent for optimal forwarder selection and another agent for optimal route selection. After routing, the load balancing is done to reduce the network overhead and scalability issues. The proposed work performs trading based load balancing by utilizing Stackelberg Game Model in which all the local controllers are considered as followers and global controller is considered as leaders. All the transactions are stored in the DAG blockchain to reduce the scalability and Proof-of Authentication (PoAH) used to verify the transactions. The proposed work is simulated using NS-3.26 simulation tool and compared with several existing works by validation metrics like throughput at 2.55(mbps), latency at 27.1(ms), packet delivery ratio at 91.5(%), network Lifetime at 546.5(s), and energy consumption at 14.5 (J).

Beacon scheduling for broadcast and convergecast in ZigBee wireless sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.comcom.2013.10.009,6,article,ACM,2014,"Broadcast and convergecast are two fundamental operations which often happen simultaneously in a wireless sensor network. Previous works have addressed energy-efficient, low-latency scheduling but they only try to optimize the traffic in one direction (broadcast or convergecast). This work defines a low-latency two-way beacon scheduling (LTBS) problem for ZigBee tree-based networks, where beacons stand for timing for nodes to deliver broadcast and convergecast traffics. We formulate the problem as a slot assignment problem where each node needs to obtain slots for upstream and downstream transmissions while avoiding interferences. We propose two efficient slot assignment algorithms based on the concept of sequencing nodes' slots to facilitate two-way traffics. We show the advantages of these schemes through extensive simulations. The results indicate that these two slot assignment algorithms can indeed achieve low-latency in ZigBee networks.",none
Q-learning based routing for in-network aggregation in wireless sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11276-021-02564-8,1,research-article,ACM,2021,"In-network data aggregation is an inherent paradigm that extends the lifetime of resource-constrained wireless sensor networks (WSNs). By aggregating sensor data at intermediate nodes, it eliminates data redundancy, minimizes the number of transmissions and saves energy. A key component of in-network data aggregation is the design of an optimal routing structure. However, when the monitoring environment is highly dynamic, the conventional in-network aggregation routing algorithms lead to unnecessary redesign, high overhead and inferior performance, and make in-network aggregation a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel adaptive routing algorithm for in-network aggregation (RINA) in wireless sensor networks. The proposed approach employs a reinforcement learning method called Q-learning to build a routing tree based on minimal information such as residual energy, distance between nodes and link strength. In addition, it finds the aggregation points in the routing structure to maximize the number of overlapping routes in order to increase the aggregation ratio. Theoretical analysis proves the feasibility of the proposed approach. Simulation results show that the aggregation tree constructed by RINA increases the network lifetime by achieving optimum data aggregation and outperform other state-of-the-art approaches in terms of different significant features under different simulation scenarios.",none

A DRL-based Partial Charging Algorithm for Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3661999,1,research-article,ACM,2024,"Breakthroughs in Wireless Energy Transfer technologies have revitalized Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks. However, how to schedule mobile chargers rationally has been quite a tricky problem. Most of the current work does not consider the variability of scenarios and how many mobile chargers should be scheduled as the most appropriate for each dispatch. At the same time, the focus of most work on the mobile charger scheduling problem has always been on reducing the number of dead nodes, and the most critical metric of network performance, packet arrival rate, is relatively neglected. In this article, we develop a DRL-based Partial Charging algorithm. Based on the number and urgency of charging requests, we classify charging requests into four scenarios. And for each scenario, we design a corresponding request allocation algorithm. Then, a Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm is employed to train a decision model using environmental information to select which request allocation algorithm is optimal for the current scenario. After the allocation of charging requests is confirmed, to improve the Quality of Service, i.e., the packet arrival rate of the entire network, a partial charging scheduling algorithm is designed to maximize the total charging duration of nodes in the ideal state while ensuring that all charging requests are completed. In addition, we analyze the traffic information of the nodes and use the Analytic Hierarchy Process to determine the importance of the nodes to compensate for the inaccurate estimation of the node’s remaining lifetime in realistic scenarios.

Further a new data aggregation method is introduced in this article customized for IoT based WSN to acquaint higher crop yield in precision farming. Nevertheless, the scalability becomes a primary concern when deployed in larger and denser networks. This is due to the fact that all nodes in IoT and WSN are mostly alive depending on higher usage of bandwidth and power. The primal aim is to build a novel routing protocol developed for IoT-WSN. Apart from this, an Energy aware Clustered Routing that is motivated by Adaptive Elephant Herding Optimization (E2CR-AEHO) is proposed, which sensors collect data and find a group of Cluster Heads (CHs).

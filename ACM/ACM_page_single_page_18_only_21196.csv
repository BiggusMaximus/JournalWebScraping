A Routing Protocol for Detecting Holes in Wireless Sensor Networks with Multiple Sinks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2791405.2791480,2,research-article,ACM,2015,"In wireless sensor networks, data routing in an optimal way is a challenging task while tackling the limited energy constraint at the same time. Our goal is not only to enhance network's lifetime for the available limited network energy, but also to detect the sub-areas in the network, which have run out of energy or became a dead zone i.e. hole. The hole detection algorithm used in our work detects such dead zones and help the network coordinators to mitigate the problem before it hampers the whole network functioning. The simulation results have shown the ability of the protocol to optimally route data packets in a multiple sink scenario and detect hole(s) when it occurs.

LA-CWSN,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.comcom.2016.07.006,3,research-article,ACM,2016,"Cognitive networking deals with using cognition to the entire network protocol stack to achieve stack-wide, as well as network-wide performance goals; unlike cognitive radios that apply cognition only at the physical layer to overcome the problem of spectrum scarcity. Adding cognition to the existing Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) with a cognitive networking approach brings about many benefits. To the best of our knowledge, almost all the existing researches on the Cognitive Wireless Sensor Networks (CWSNs) have focused on spectrum allocation and interference reduction, which are related to the physical layer optimization. In this paper, an inference and learning model for CWSNs, named LA-CWSN, is proposed. This model uses learning automata to bring cognition to the entire network protocol stack, with the aim of providing end-to-end goal. Learning automata are assigned to the parameters of the important network protocols. Each automaton has a finite set of possible values of the corresponding parameter, and it tries to learn the best one, which maximize the network performance. Each node in the network has its own group of learning automata, which act independently, however all nodes receive the same feedbacks from the environment. To clarify the proposed model a traffic control scenario in WSN is considered. Using the network simulator ns-2.35, we test the proposed inference and learning model for traffic control in a WSN. The results show that learning automata approach works well to apply cognition in WSNs.",none

Fuzzy Logic Based Distance and Energy-Aware Routing Protocol in Delay-Tolerant Mobile Sensor Networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11277-018-5360-y,8,article,ACM,2018,"In challenged networks such as Wireless Sensor Networks, limitations such as nodes mobility, short radio range and sparse network density can prevent communications among nodes. Consequently, it can result in long delays in exchanging messages among nodes. Designing Delay-Tolerant Networks is considered to be an approach for dealing with lengthy breakdown of communication between nodes. Using multi-replica methods seems rational for these networks. However, a majority of these methods inject a large amount of replications of a message in the network so as to enhance message delivery probability which consequently leads to the loss of energy and reduction of network efficiency. Two major issues should be considered to achieve data delivery in such challenging networking environments: a routing strategy for the network and a buffer management policy. This study proposes a new routing protocol called Fuzzy-Logic based Distance and Energy Aware Routing protocol (FLDEAR) in delay tolerant mobile sensor network. A FLDEAR is a distance and energy aware protocol that reduces the number of message replications and uses two fuzzy inference systems in routing and buffer management. The results of conducted simulations indicated that this routing algorithm can be used for enhancing data packet delivery ratios and reducing data transmission overhead than several current Delay-Tolerant Mobile Sensor Networks routing protocols.",none

Swarm Intelligence with Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System-Based Routing Protocol for Clustered Wireless Sensor Networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1155/2022/7940895,2,research-article,ACM,2022,"Wireless sensor network (WSN) comprises numerous compact-sized sensor nodes which are linked to one another. Lifetime maximization of WSN is considered a challenging problem in the design of WSN since its energy-limited capacity of the inbuilt batteries exists in the sensor nodes. Earlier works have focused on the design of clustering and routing techniques to accomplish energy efficiency and thereby result in an increased lifetime of the network. The multihop route selection process can be treated as an NP-hard problem and can be solved by the use of computational intelligence techniques such as fuzzy logic and swarm intelligence (SI) algorithms. With this motivation, this article aims to focus on the design of swarm intelligence with an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system-based routing (SI-ANFISR) protocol for clustered WSN. The proposed SI-ANFISR technique aims to determine the cluster heads (CHs) and optimal routes for multihop communication in the network. To accomplish this, the SI-ANFISR technique primarily employs a weighted clustering algorithm to elect CHs and construct clusters. Besides, the SI-ANFISR technique involves the design of an ANFIS model for the selection process, which make use of three input parameters, namely, residual energy, node degree, and node history. In order to optimally adjust the membership function (MF) of the ANFIS model, the squirrel search algorithm (SSA) is utilized. None of the earlier works have used ANFIS with SSA for the routing process. The design of SSA to tune the MFs of the ANFIS model for optimal routing process in WSN shows the novelty of the study.

Minimizing the energy dissipation, maximizing the network lifetime, and security are considered as the major quality of service (QoS) factors in the design of WSN. Clustering is a commonly employed energy-efficient technique; however, it results in a hot spot issue. This paper develops a novel secure unequal clustering protocol with intrusion detection technique to achieve QoS parameters like energy, lifetime, and security. Initially, the proposed model uses adaptive neuro fuzzy based clustering technique to select the tentative cluster heads (TCHs) using three input parameters such as residual energy, distance to base station (BS), and distance to neighbors. Then, the TCHs compete for final CHs and the optimal CHs are selected using the deer hunting optimization (DHO) algorithm. The DHO based clustering technique derives a fitness function using residual energy, distance to BS, node degree, node centrality, and link quality. To further improve the performance of the proposed method, the cluster maintenance phase is utilized for load balancing. Finally, to achieve security in cluster based WSN, an effective intrusion detection system using a deep belief network is executed on the CHs to identify the presence of intruders in the network.

BCEWN: Design of a Hybrid Bioinspired Clustering Model for Deployment of Energy-Aware Wireless Networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11277-024-11377-9,0,research-article,ACM,2024,"A low-power wireless network design is an iterative process that integrates multiple optimization techniques to identify and mitigate redundant network operations. Existing power-aware models either showcase higher complexity or require larger information sets, which limits their scalability for real-time networks. Moreover, these models work well under an elaborative set network configuration but cannot be used for general-purpose networks. The study suggests creating a novel hybrid bioinspired clustering model for energy-aware wireless network deployment to address these problems. The proposed model initially collects limited network information sets, including approximate node locations, residual energy levels, temporal throughput, and packet delivery levels. These sets are processed via a Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), which performs initial binary-clustering operations. These binary clusters are generated by iterative identification of high-energy nodes between a given set of source & destination pairs. Results of the clustering process are used to train a Particle Swarm Optimizer (PSO) that uses the temporal information sets to identify energy-aware routing paths. The PSO models a temporal fitness function capable of reducing redundant node selections, thereby improving network lifetime even under many communication requests. Performance of the GWO-clustering & PSO-routing model was validated under large-scale scenarios, and it was observed that the proposed model reduced energy consumption by 8.3% while improving communication speed by 3.2% with a 4.5% higher data rate and 2.9% higher packet delivery performance under real-time heterogeneous network scenarios.",none

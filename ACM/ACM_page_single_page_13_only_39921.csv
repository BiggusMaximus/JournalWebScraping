A WSN typically consists of multipurpose sensor hubs for data sensing, processing, and communication. These networks are more suited to conveying medical data from various geographical regions and sending private medical data to the network owner. However, the worry about various attacks on health care data normally grows daily. These assaults could quickly have adverse impacts on the WSN-IoT (Internet of Things) nodes. Additionally, the low detection rate, significant processing overhead, and resource limitations of current intrusion detection systems all contribute to an increase in false alarm rates when trying to identify various attacks.

In the past decades, various algorithms have been proposed for UAV route planning. However, they still have defects, such as stagnation and slow search rates. In this study, a novel hybrid algorithm which integrates ant colony optimization (ACO) and intelligent water drop (IWD) is proposed for UAV route planning. First, the advantages of the IWD and ACO algorithms are combined in an iterative strategy, to ensure mutual cooperation via exchange of information for route optimization. Initially, the water drops optimize the soil and pheromones within the environment simultaneously to generate good approximate solutions and an initial pheromone distribution for the ant colony. Based thereupon, the ant colony roams the solution space to further optimize the routes, thus combining the exploration potential and exploitability of two types of agents. Additionally, a novel node selection strategy is proposed to guide the agents’ route planning along a reasonable direction. Compared with state-of-the-art algorithms, the convergence accuracy, success rate, and stability of the proposed algorithm exhibited significant improvements of approximately 8.25%, 4.20%, and 66.20%, respectively.",none

Classic networks usually exploit distributed routing algorithms which pave the way to issues in controlling the network paths and accessing the data in concern with the global topology. The recently developed Software Defined Networking (SDN) is flexibly scalable and is more cost-efficient for operators and vendors of information technology. Software-defined networking is a new type of network with emerging ideas and the ability to adapt network parameters. To adapt to the changing environment the data processing (data plane) and the logic processing (control plane) layers are separated in SDN. The separation in the data plane and control plane improved the traffic and routing performance of the network.

FL-Sleep: Temperature adaptive multi-attribute sleep-scheduling algorithm using hesitant fuzzy logic for Wireless Sensor Networks▪,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.asoc.2022.108910,2,research-article,ACM,2022,"The sustainable operation of sensor nodes in Wireless Sensor Network depends on the nodes’ adaptability with the environment. A sensor node strives to live longer using periodic sleep/awake activity. But it fails to achieve considerable success due to the node’s inability to make the sleep/awake strategy adaptive to the environment. To this end, we propose an algorithm, ‘FL-Sleep’ which makes every node in the network to observe the ambient temperature and status of their parameters after every round of operation. Depending on their perception of the parameters, the nodes execute a sleep-scheduling strategy in the subsequent round. It makes the node evaluate its current state and decide the required action (’Active’, ‘Listen’ or ‘Sleep’) to perform. A node working in a favorable condition would decide the action with an optimistic attitude towards the parameters. In contrast, a critical condition of a node compels it to decide pessimistically. This qualitative measurement provides a precise understanding of the environment. ‘FL-Sleep’ works on hesitant fuzzy logic-based Multi-Criteria Decision Making method and is found to improve the network’s lifetime by 247.11% compared to BMAC, by 68.56% compared to SOPC, and by 77.2% compared to RL-Sleep.

In an IoT system, a major role is played by the wireless sensor network as its components comprise: sensing, data acquiring, heterogeneous connectivity and data processing. Mobile ad-hoc networks are highly self reconfiguring networks of mobile nodes which communicate through wireless links. In such a network, each node acts both as a router and host at the same time. The interaction between MANETs and Internet of Things opens new ways for service provision in smart environments and challenging issues in its networking aspects. One of the main issues in MANET–IoT systems is the mobility of the network nodes: routing protocol must react effectively to the topological changes into the algorithm design. We describe the design and implementation of AQ-Routing, and analyze its performance using both simulations and measurements based on our implementation. In general, the networking of such a system is very challenging regarding routing aspects. Also, it is related to system mobility and limited network sensor resources. This article builds upon this observation an adaptive routing protocol (AQ-Routing) based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques, which has the ability to detect the level of mobility at different points of time so that each individual node can update routing metric accordingly. The proposed protocol introduces: (i) new model, developed via Q-learning technique, to detect the level of mobility at each node in the network; (ii) a new metric, called Qmetric, which account for the static and dynamic routing metrics, and which are combined and updated to the changing network topologies. The protocol can efficiently handle network mobility by a way of preemptively adapting its behaviour thanks to the mobility detection model. The presented results of simulation provide an effective approach to improve the stability of links in both static and mobile scenario and, hence, increase the packet delivery ratio in the global MANET–IoT system.",none

For a large scale IoT application, sensors are needed in huge numbers and all these sensors are powered by small battery. Hence, these miniature devices' lifetime can be improved by means of optimising the power and hence modelling of these sensors is a must for such application. This paper models the sensors for IoT application in the multi-layered IoT network. Reinforcement learning is used for modelling the sensors that model in the physical, routing and network layer.

Application of reinforcement learning to routing in distributed wireless networks: a review,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s10462-012-9383-6,11,article,ACM,2015,"The dynamicity of distributed wireless networks caused by node mobility, dynamic network topology, and others has been a major challenge to routing in such networks. In the traditional routing schemes, routing decisions of a wireless node may solely depend on a predefined set of routing policies, which may only be suitable for a certain network circumstances. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been shown to address this routing challenge by enabling wireless nodes to observe and gather information from their dynamic local operating environment, learn, and make efficient routing decisions on the fly. In this article, we focus on the application of the traditional, as well as the enhanced, RL models, to routing in wireless networks. The routing challenges associated with different types of distributed wireless networks, and the advantages brought about by the application of RL to routing are identified. In general, three types of RL models have been applied to routing schemes in order to improve network performance, namely Q-routing, multi-agent reinforcement learning, and partially observable Markov decision process. We provide an extensive review on new features in RL-based routing, and how various routing challenges and problems have been approached using RL. We also present a real hardware implementation of a RL-based routing scheme. Subsequently, we present performance enhancements achieved by the RL-based routing schemes. Finally, we discuss various open issues related to RL-based routing schemes in distributed wireless networks, which help to explore new research directions in this area.

Cognitive radio network (CRN) enables unlicensed users (or secondary users, SUs) to sense for and opportunistically operate in underutilized licensed channels, which are owned by the licensed users (or primary users, PUs). Cognitive radio network (CRN) has been regarded as the next-generation wireless network centered on the application of artificial intelligence, which helps the SUs to learn about, as well as to adaptively and dynamically reconfigure its operating parameters, including the sensing and transmission channels, for network performance enhancement. This motivates the use of artificial intelligence to enhance security schemes for CRNs. Provisioning security in CRNs is challenging since existing techniques, such as entity authentication, are not feasible in the dynamic environment that CRN presents since they require pre-registration. In addition these techniques cannot prevent an authenticated node from acting maliciously. In this article, we advocate the use of reinforcement learning (RL) to achieve optimal or near-optimal solutions for security enhancement through the detection of various malicious nodes and their attacks in CRNs. RL, which is an artificial intelligence technique, has the ability to learn new attacks and to detect previously learned ones. RL has been perceived as a promising approach to enhance the overall security aspect of CRNs. RL, which has been applied to address the dynamic aspect of security schemes in other wireless networks, such as wireless sensor networks and wireless mesh networks can be leveraged to design security schemes in CRNs. We believe that these RL solutions will complement and enhance existing security solutions applied to CRN To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey article that focuses on the use of RL-based techniques for security enhancement in CRNs.",none

While compressed sensing (CS) has been recognized as a valuable framework for enhancing the performance of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), further enhancements are still required to improve the effectiveness of data aggregation at the sink node. This work presents a framework named grid-based synchronized routing using Bayesian compressive sensing (GSR-BCS) for the purpose of enhancing transmission efficiency. The field of grid-based synchronized routing investigates the correlation between various forms of sensed data, such as pressure, fluid, and temperature, within a network. In addition, it explores the impact of different grid sizes on this relationship. The identification of an ideal grid size based on sensed data plays a crucial role in enhancing transmission efficiency in terms of data size or transmission rate. This, in turn, leads to an extension of the lifespan of the network. The application of grid-based synchronized route Bayesian compressive sensing is utilized to achieve efficient data aggregation at the sink. The primary objective is to enhance the data aggregation rate, also known as accuracy, by mitigating ambiguity through the implementation of Bayesian compressed data aggregation. In this work, the Bayesian compressive grid approximation method is introduced as a promising approach for reducing the number of transmissions and minimizing transmission time. Simulations are additionally performed to corroborate the theoretical findings across several scenarios utilizing the MATLAB/SIMULINK software.

They are made up of several sensor nodes, which keep track of a variety of physical and environmental parameters, like temperature and humidity. The nodes are autonomous, self-configuring, and wireless. A significant problem in WSNs is that sensors in these networks consume a lot of energy. Energy consumption is a big issue when it comes to the deployment of sensor networks. The reason for this is the cost of operating a sensor node and the cost incurred due to energy consumption. Energy optimization is based on intelligent energy management. This paper presents a reinforcement learning-based and clustering-enhanced method. Reinforcement learning is a set of algorithms inspired by operant conditioning in animal behavior, and clustering-based methods have been extensively used for devising energy-efficient protocols. The proposed method is able to plan and schedule the nodes to ensure an extended network lifetime.

In NPSOP, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique is used to select the cluster heads (CHs) and find the routing paths for each CH by encoding them into a single particle simultaneously. Moreover, the components of a particle is constrained by parameters residual energy, centrality, distance to the BS so as to improve the convergence speed. In addition, the fitness function considering network energy consumption and load balancing is derived to evaluate the quality of particles. And an adaptive inertial weight is used to update the status of each particle in order to escape from trapping into local optima. Iteratively, the global optimal solution can be reached in the end.

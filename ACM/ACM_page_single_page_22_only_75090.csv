Energy efficient chain based cooperative routing protocol for WSN,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.asoc.2015.06.034,10,research-article,ACM,2015,"Number of rounds versus number of dead nodes. This paper has presented the our new routing protocol with all results in QoS (Quality of service metrics) of WSN (Wireless Sensor Nodes) and it is compared with LEACH, SEP, genetic HCR and ERP routing protocols.This research is useful for densely deployed networks (Terrestrial, Environmental and Border surveillance applications).This paper presents the routing protocol in which data is transmitted thorough the CHs and CCOs for intra and inter cluster communication.Our research has optimized many parameters of sensor nodes as Energy, Time, Reliability, Throughput and scalability and results calculated in MATLAB validate our work. In this paper, we investigate the reduction in total transmission time and the energy consumption of wireless sensor networks using multi-hop data aggregation by forming coordination in hierarchical clustering. Novel algorithm handles wireless sensor network in numerous circumstances as in large extent and high density deployments. One of the major purposes is to collect information from inaccessible areas by using factorization of the area into subareas (clusters) and appointing cluster head in each of the subarea. Coordination and cooperation among the local nodes via relay nodes in local cluster (By forming sub clusters) helped to serve each and every node. Routing is based on the predefined path, proposed by new transmission algorithm. Transmission distance is minimized by using cluster coordinators for inter cluster communication and relay nodes within the cluster. We show by extended simulations that Chain Based Cluster Cooperative Protocol (CBCCP) performs very well in terms of energy and time. To prove it, we compare it with LEACH, SEP, genetic HCR and ERP and found that new protocol consumes six times less energy than LEACH, five times less energy than SEP, four time less energy than genetic HCR and three times less energy than ERP, which further validate our work.",none
Research on Dynamic Spectrum Allocation Algorithm Based on Cyclic Neural Network,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1155/2022/7928300,0,research-article,ACM,2022,"Due to the wide application of cognitive wireless network, the network structure is becoming more and more complex. It is difficult to establish the corresponding mathematical model to simulate the high complexity network environment. The algorithm based on recurrent neural network in deep reinforcement learning can effectively solve this problem. In addition, with the rise of deep learning in recent years, the combination of reinforcement learning and deep learning shows excellent ability in dealing with complex problems and data operation. This paper is aimed at studying dynamic spectrum allocation based on cyclic neural network. This paper briefly introduces MATLAB, sets up the network environment of algorithm simulation, then analyzes the overall performance of the improved genetic algorithm, and explores the influence of genetic algorithm-related parameters and network environment-related parameters on the performance of the algorithm. The results show the improved genetic algorithm. The network efficiency can be improved by about 2%, but the spectrum switching frequency can be reduced by 69%. When the number of primary users in the network is large, the network benefit of improving the genetic algorithm is superior to the other two algorithms. In addition, when the crossover probability is 0.6 and 0.1, the fitness value is higher than the crossover probability of 0.9 and 0.5; the interference of authorized users in the network initially has less impact on the secondary user.",none
Review: A survey on intelligent routing protocols in wireless sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.jnca.2013.04.001,25,article,ACM,2014,"This paper surveys intelligent routing protocols which contribute to the optimization of network lifetime in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Different from other surveys on routing protocols for WSNs, this paper first puts forward new ideas on the definition of network lifetime. Then, with a view to prolonging network lifetime, it discusses the routing protocols based on such intelligent algorithms as reinforcement learning (RL), ant colony optimization (ACO), fuzzy logic (FL), genetic algorithm (GA), and neural networks (NNs). Intelligent algorithms provide adaptive mechanisms that exhibit intelligent behavior in complex and dynamic environments like WSNs. Inspired by such an idea, some intelligent routing protocols have recently been designed for WSNs.

ENROUTE: An Entropy Aware Routing Scheme for Information-Centric Networks (ICN),https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11277-021-08944-9,0,research-article,ACM,2022,"With the exponential growth of end users and web data, the internet is undergoing the change of paradigm from a user-centric model to a content-centric one, popularly known as information-centric networks (ICN). Current ICN research evolves around three key-issues namely (i) content request searching, (ii) content routing, and (iii) in-network caching scheme to deliver the requested content to the end user. This would improve the user experience to obtain requested content because it lowers the download delay and provides higher throughput. Existing researches have mainly focused on on-path congestion or expected delivery time of a content to determine the optimized path towards custodian. However, it ignores the cumulative effect of the link-state parameters and the state of the cache, and consequently it leads to degrade the delay performance. In order to overcome this shortfall, we consider both the congestion of a link and the state of on-path caches to determine the best possible routes. We introduce a generic term entropy to quantify the effects of link congestion and state of on-path caches. Thereafter, we develop a novel entropy dependent algorithm namely ENROUTE for searching of content request triggered by any user, routing of this content, and caching for the delivery this requested content to the user. The entropy value of an intra-domain node indicates how many popular contents are already cached in the node, which, in turn, signifies the degree of enrichment of that node with the popular contents. On the other hand, the entropy for a link indicates how much the link is congested with the traversal of contents. In order to have reduced delay, we enhance the entropy of caches in nodes, and also use path with low entropy for downloading contents. We evaluate the performance of our proposed ENROUTE algorithm against state-of-the-art schemes for various network parameters and observe an improvement of 29–52% in delay, 12–39% in hit rate, and 4–39% in throughput.",none
Blockchain model for environment/infrastructure monitoring in cloud-enabled high-altitude platform systems,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.vehcom.2023.100627,0,research-article,ACM,2023,"The recently accentuated features of augmenting conventional wireless networks with high altitude platform systems (HAPS) have fueled a plethora of applications, which promise to offer new services to ground users, as well to enhance the efficiency and pervasion of existing applications. Cloud-enabled HAPS, which aims to create HAPS-based datacenters that offer cloud services to users, has particularly emerged as a promising key enabler to provide large-scale equitable services from the sky.

A hybrid coverage control for enhancing UWSN localizability using IBSO-VFA,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.adhoc.2021.102694,2,research-article,ACM,2021,"Underwater node coverage is the basis of various applications in underwater wireless sensor network (UWSN). It is easy to cause the coordinates of underwater nodes drift affected by water flow action. Some sparsely deployed underwater nodes may form coverage holes, which makes it impossible to locate underwater targets effectively. Combined with the water flow situation, this paper proposes an improved brain storm optimization integrated with virtual force algorithm (IBSO-VFA) for improving UWSN coverage performance. After analyzing the water jet model and the resultant force along Z axis, the velocity components of east, north and depth directions can be derived, which can reveal the coordinate evolution model of drifted underwater nodes under water flow action. Underwater nodes present non-uniform distribution of partly sparse and partly dense coverage, even with a lot of coverage holes. Inspired by the virtual force algorithm, the drifted underwater nodes are driven to their relative communicable positions. Meanwhile, the brain storm optimization has been improved and applied to avoid falling into local coverage optimum by pure VFA. Based on the node maximum coverage, the dual mapping of signal domain and localizability domain is established in consideration of ranging and coordinate errors. Finally, a comprehensive performance test is conducted to evaluate IBSO-VFA performance in terms of coverage rates, k-coverage and localizability area. The results indicate that the IBSO-VFA can maximize the UWSN coverage and localizability performance. The proposed IBSO-VFA can provide a close-to-practical coverage model for drifted underwater nodes, and can provide a theoretical basis for ocean information perception in UWSN.",none
The distributed Gauss-Newton methods for solving the inverse of approximated Hessian with application to target localization,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3403746.3403900,2,research-article,ACM,2020,"Gauss-Newton method is a Hessian free second-order Newton's optimization method, which can be used to solve the common nonlinear least squares (NLLS) problems. In this paper, we consider the collaborative target localization problem in a wireless sensor network with a random topology structure. By using a specialized decomposition technique, the centralized Gauss-Newton method is modified as a distributed solution by exchanging locally information with the neighboring anchor nodes. In the recent diffusion Gauss-Newton algorithm, the main difficulty is the computation of inverse because the approximated Hessian is not always full column rank. To address this problem, we propose that two methods can be used to approximate the inverse matrix, i.e., Levenberg-Marquardt parameter and Moore-Penrose inverse methods. The former in essence is a damped iteration method, while the latter depends largely on the adjustment of step size. In addition to proposing the methods above for diffusion Gauss-Newton algorithm, we also compare their performance to solve the collaborative localization in wireless sensor networks, which can be modeled as a NLLS problem. Simulation results show both of them are applicable to diffusion GN, and LM method has some slight advantages in these respects such as resistance to environment noise while guaranteeing convergence, and dynamical increasing/decreasing to step size.",none

A sensor network is an autonomous self-resource constraint collection of internet of things (IoT) sensor nodes. The nodes communicate in an ad-hoc fashion to transfer cloud information over the virtual environment.

Development and trends of chicken farming robots in chicken farming tasks: A review,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.compag.2024.108916,0,review-article,ACM,2024,"ts•Navigation and interaction technology of chicken farming robots are discussed.•Chicken farming robots for four types of poultry farming tasks are discussed.•Application challenges of robots in chicken houses and solutions are proposed.•Future research focus and development trend of chicken farming robots are proposed.AbstractChicken farming plays a crucial role in the chicken industry. As the market demand for chicken products continues to grow, chicken farming is expanding on a larger scale to meet production needs. To address the challenges posed by the increased workload and labor shortages in chicken farming, chicken farming is transitioning towards standardization, automation, and intelligence. The rapid development of mobile robot technology offers solutions for the automated and intelligent execution of tasks in various scenarios. The automated and intelligent execution of farming tasks by robots holds significant importance in terms of liberating labor, implementing standardization and stable production, ensuring animal welfare, and enhancing production efficiency. In this review, the current situation in the chicken industry and the challenges encountered in implementing automation and intelligence in chicken farming tasks have been summarized to fully illustrate the important role of robots in the automation and intelligence of chicken farming. Based on the proposed categorization that considers the generality of robot technology, we review the application of general-purpose robotic technologies in chicken farming, such as localization, mapping, path planning, control, and interaction technology. Additionally, we explore the development of task-specific robotic technologies for various chicken farming tasks, including inspection, dead chicken picking, chicken house cleaning, and floor egg picking. Some tables are used to record and summarize certain technologies. We have identified that there are still many challenges to overcome in order to achieve mature and stable operation of robots in chicken farming. These challenges include significant technology homogeneity and a lack of attention to the characteristics of scenes and objects in chicken farming environments. To ultimately achieve the goal of an intelligent unmanned chicken farming system, future research priorities and development trends have been highlighted.",none
Stochastic data acquisition for answering queries as time goes by,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.14778/3021924.3021942,3,research-article,ACM,2016,"Data and actions are tightly coupled. On one hand, data analysis results trigger decision making and actions. On the other hand, the action of acquiring data is the very first step in the whole data processing pipeline. Data acquisition almost always has some costs, which could be either monetary costs or computing resource costs such as sensor battery power, network transfers, or I/O costs. Using out-dated data to answer queries can avoid the data acquisition costs, but there is a penalty of potentially inaccurate results. Given a sequence of incoming queries over time, we study the problem of sequential decision making on when to acquire data and when to use existing versions to answer each query. We propose two approaches to solve this problem using reinforcement learning and tailored locality-sensitive hashing. A systematic empirical study using two real-world datasets shows that our approaches are effective and efficient.",none
Copyright Protection of Music Multimedia Works Fused With Digital Audio Watermarking Algorithm,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.4018/IJGHPC.318406,1,article,ACM,2023,"Copyright law is important in the media sector since an original creative work owner has the exclusive right to consent, publish, broadcast, and even translate or modify their work.

Multi-antenna relay based cyber-physical systems in smart-healthcare NTNs: an explainable AI approach,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s10586-022-03632-0,0,research-article,ACM,2022,"In a generic modern multi-antenna relay system, the incremental cooperative networks use the neighbor nodes to assist the source by sending the source message to the destination for achieving spatial diversity. Therefore, the involvement of cyber-physical Systems (CPS) in smart healthcare has proportionately improved in terms of the relaying schemes. These schemes are equally implicated to terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks. For any non-terrestrial-networks (NTN), the computational intelligence in terms of artificial intelligence (AI) plays a viral role, the work have introduced a novel paradigm of NTN applications using Explainable-artificial intelligence (X-AI) approach.

Mathematical formulations have been deducted to support an optimal relationship between signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and neighbour nodes in the physical layer. The simulations are presented to showcase the validation of the work. The analysis of the obtained simulation results shows that the proposed scheme outperforms in minimizing Bit-Error-Rate (BER) and outage probability as compared to the existing CPS-based relaying schemes such as IMARC-AF, IMARC-DF, etc.",none
IEEE 802.15.4e,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.comcom.2016.05.004,24,research-article,ACM,2016,"Several studies have highlighted that the IEEE 802.15.4 standard presents a number of limitations such as low reliability, unbounded packet delays and no protection against interference/fading, that prevent its adoption in applications with stringent requirements in terms of reliability and latency.

Energy efficient clustering protocol based on improved metaheuristic in wireless sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.jnca.2017.01.031,19,research-article,ACM,2017,"Energy efficient clustering is a well accepted NP-hard optimization problem in Wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Diverse paradigm of Computational intelligence (CI) including Evolutionary algorithms (EAs), Reinforcement learning (RL), Artificial immune systems (AIS), and more recently, Artificial bee colony (ABC) metaheuristic have been used for energy efficient clustering in WSNs. Due to ease of use and adaptive nature, ABC arose much interest over other population-based metaheuristics for solving optimization problems in WSNs. However, its search equation, which is comparably poor at exploitation and require storage of certain control parameters, contributes to its insufficiency. Thus, we present an improved Artificial bee colony (iABC) metaheuristic with an improved solution search equation to improve its exploitation capabilities. Additionally, in order to increase the global convergence of the proposed metaheuristic, an improved population sampling technique is introduced through Studentst distribution, which require only one control parameter to compute and store, hence increase efficiency of proposed metaheuristic. The proposed metaheuristic maintain a good balance between exploration and exploitation search abilities with least memory requirements, moreover the use of first of its kind compact Studentst distribution, make it suitable for limited hardware requirements of WSNs. Further, an energy efficient clustering protocol based on iABC metaheuristic is introduced, which inherit the capabilities of the proposed metaheuristic to obtain optimal cluster heads (CHs) and improve energy efficiency in WSNs. Simulation results shows that the proposed clustering protocol outperforms other well known protocols on the basis of packet delivery, throughput, energy consumption, network lifetime and latency as performance metric.",none
Routing algorithms for wireless sensor networks using ant colony optimization,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1927099.1927133,2,Article,ACM,2010,"Wireless Sensor Networks have become an active research topic in the last years.

A packet scheduler for real-time 6LoWPAN wireless networks in manufacturing systems,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s10845-014-0977-5,1,article,ACM,2017,"Modern manufacturing processes rely on industrial Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) for the monitoring of parameters critical for a broad range of applications. One of the most important standards used for the implementation of industrial WSN is the IPv6 over Low power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN). This standard provides wireless internet connectivity, warranting interoperability with already existing infrastructures. Due to the increasing importance of the process monitoring in the manufacturing domain, it is required that the 6LoWPAN transmission control mechanisms are efficient, robust and that they guarantee real-time responses with low data losses. This paper presents a packet scheduler for real-time 6LoWPAN wireless networks in manufacturing systems that adapts wireless scheduling mechanisms and decision algorithms to the IEEE 802.15.4 beacon-enabled mode. In previous works, the scheduling algorithm does not change during the packet scheduling process. The work described in this paper proposes a new approach to the design of scheduling mechanisms by presenting a scheduling system that can adapt to the dynamic wireless traffic of industrial WSN. The system implemented manages the channel access by allocating Guaranteed Time Slots to sensor nodes according to the priority given by scheduling algorithms that are selected according to the traffic condition of the network.",none
An Improved Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm for UAV Base Station Placement,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11277-023-10334-2,2,research-article,ACM,2023,"In cellular networks, a set of Base Stations (BSs) might be out of service and failed in the aftermath of natural disasters. One of the promising solutions to fix this situation is to send low altitude drones equipped with a small cellular BS (DBSs) to the target locations. This can provide cellular networks with vital communication links and make available temporary coverage for the users in unexpected circumstances. However, finding the minimum number of DBSs and their optimal locations are highly challenging issues. In this paper, a Mixed-Integer Non-Linear Programming formulation is provided, in which the DBSs’ location and the proper number of DBSs are jointly determined. An improved PSO-based algorithm is proposed to jointly optimize DBSs’ locations and find the minimum number of DBSs. As in the original PSO algorithm, the particles are randomly distributed in the initialization phase and a K-means-based clustering method is employed to generate the positions of the first-generation particles (DBSs). In addition, a custom communication protocol is presented for data exchange between the users’ equipment (UE) and the network controller. The proposed approach is evaluated through four simulation experiments implemented using Mininet-Wifi integrated with CopelliaSim. The acquired results show that the proposed solution based on the integration of PSO and K-means algorithms provides a low packet loss and latency. Moreover, it indicates that most of the users in the considered scenarios are covered by the DBSs.",none
Joint Assignment and Scheduling for Minimizing Age of Correlated Information,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TNET.2019.2936759,6,research-article,ACM,2019,"Age of information has been recently proposed to quantify the freshness of information, e.g., in cyber-physical systems, where it is of critical importance.

We consider a system consisting of wireless camera nodes with overlapping fields of view and a set of processing nodes, and address the problem of the joint optimization of processing node assignment and camera transmission scheduling, so as to minimize the maximum peak age of information from all sources. We formulate the multi-view age minimization MVAM problem, and prove its NP-hardness under the two widely used interference models as well as with given candidate transmitting groups. We provide fundamental results including tractable cases and optimality conditions of the MVAM problem for two baseline scenarios. To solve MVAM efficiently, we develop an optimization algorithm based on a decomposition approach.

Energy-Efficient Compressed Sensing in Cognitive Radio Network for Telemedicine Services,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1155/2023/5415616,0,research-article,ACM,2023,"Wireless body area networks (WBAN) are becoming a promising solution for health care applications. WBAN allows monitoring of patients continuously in their own comfort zone. These devices use the industrial, scientific, and medical band (ISM) for communication. This band is overcrowded due to the increasing number of wireless medical devices and other wireless devices occupying this band. This causes interference, which can be damaging and could result in a change in received power. However, WBAN also needs minimum and reliable energy communication for a longer lifetime and improved quality of service. This work addresses both problems and proposes solutions for the same. A cognitive radio controller is employed as a centralized controller with dynamic spectrum allocation properties to mitigate the interference. The sensing of the spectrum is based on compressed sensing with a nonreconstruction model to save energy. To quantify interference measurement, the interference mitigation factor is introduced. Further, to increase energy efficiency, the K-means algorithm is used to cluster WBANs.

SDMA: A SDN-based Architecture of Multi-modal AUVs Network,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3393527.3393558,1,research-article,ACM,2020,"Underwater sensor networks would reap multiple benefits by extending the principles of software-defined networking (SDN) to it, such as programmable and reconfigurable network, enhanced network management and efficiency.

Private key agreement and secure communication for heterogeneous sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.jpdc.2010.03.009,10,article,ACM,2010,"Key management is an important building block for all security operations in sensor networks. Most existing key management schemes try to establish shared keys for all pairs of neighbor sensors; hence, a large number of keys need to be preloaded on each sensor, which necessitates a large key space for the nodes in the network. The recent trend in research is to mainly consider homogeneous sensor networks, and to a lesser degree heterogeneous sensor networks, for key management. In this paper, we propose a novel key agreement protocol which is based on pairing-based cryptography over an elliptic curve. Using this protocol, any two nodes that need to communicate can independently compute the same secret key by using pairing and identity-based encryption properties. The proposed protocol significantly reduces the key space of a node.

In the mixed graph, arcs represent the precedence constraints and edges represent the resource constraints. The mixed graph chromatic number corresponds to the optimal schedule length. Bounds for the graph coloring are provided and a branch-and-bound strategy is subsequently developed from which we derive numerical results that allow a comparison against the current state-of-the-art heuristic.",none

One of the most significant issues in MANETs is concerned with finding a secure, safe and short route so that data can be transmitted through it. Although several routing protocols have been introduced for the network, the majority of them just consider the shortest path with the fewest number of hops. Hop criterion is considered for simple implementation and it is reliable in dynamic environments; however, queuing delay and connection delay in the intermediate nodes are not taken into consideration for selecting route in this criterion. In this paper, a fuzzy logic-based reliable routing protocol (FRRP) is proposed for MANETs which selects stable routes using fuzzy logic. It is able to optimize system efficiency. The score allocated to routes are based on four criteria: accessible bandwidth, the amount of energy of battery, the number of hops and the degree of dynamicity of nodes.

Sensors are tiny devices which can store less power and need the power to be retained until final communication. The main need is to achieve routing of the sensors while performing the data transmission should be taken care. Optimal routing technique is necessitated to transfer data from sensors in the clusters and to the central station. The main focus is to dwindle the battery power consumption and increase the network life time. In this proposed work, the route deviation is pollard by Bayesian machine learning technique which uses the posterior distribution incrementally when new evidence is occurred. The approach calculates the conditional probability using the prior knowledge to determine the route deviation and optimal route. The methodology mainly focuses on parameters like, end-to-end delay, detection of route deviation, optimal route selection and network life time. The experimental results of proposed Optimal Pollard Route Deviation using Bayesian (OPDB) protocol focuses on the evaluation metrics of machine learning algorithm in terms of accuracy and error rate. The proposed algorithm is 28.5% better in minimizing the route deviation, 86.67% improved route selection, delay is very much minimized up to 07.12% and the 93.87% improved network life time compared with other routing algorithms. The route deviation detection is 14.5% improved, optimal route selection is improved by 31.84%, delay is minimized by 20.32% and network lifetime is increased by15.24% while using the OPDB algorithm.",none

Latency improvement strategies for reliability-aware scheduling in Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1155/2015/178368,0,article,ACM,2015,"We propose novel strategies for end-to-end reliability-aware scheduling in Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks (IWSNs). Because of stringent reliability requirements in industrial applications where missed packets may have disastrous or lethal consequences, all IWSN communication standards are based on Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), allowing for deterministic channel access on theMAC layer. We therefore extend an existing generic and scalable reliability-aware scheduling approach by the name of SchedEx. SchedEx has proven to quickly produce TDMA schedules that guarantee a user-defined end-to-end reliability level ρ for all multihop communication in a WSN. Moreover, SchedEx executes orders of magnitude faster than recent algorithms in the literature while producing schedules with competitive latencies. We generalize the original problem formulation from single-channel to multichannel scheduling and propose a scalable integration into the existing SchedEx approach. We further introduce a novel optimal bound that produces TDMA schedules with latencies around 20% shorter than the original SchedEx algorithm. Combining the novel strategies withmultiple sinks, multiple channels, and the introduced optimal bound, we could through simulations verify latency improvements by almost an order of magnitude, reducing the TDMA superframe execution times from tens of seconds to seconds only, which allows for a utilization of SchedEx for many time-critical control applications.",none
Increasing Aggregation Convergecast Data Collection Frequency through Pipelining,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1155/2018/1539642,0,research-article,ACM,2018,"We consider the problem of increasing the data collection frequency of aggregation convergecast. Previous studies attempt to increase the data collection frequency by shortening the completion of a single data collection cycle. We aim at increasing the frequency at which data collection updates are collected by the use of pipelining and, consequently, increasing the overall data collection frequency and throughput. To achieve this, we overlap the propagation schedule of multiple data snapshots within the same overall schedule cycle, thus increasing parallelism through pipelining. Consequently, the effective data collection time of an individual snapshot may span over multiple, successive, schedule cycles. To this end, we modify the aggregation convergecast model, decoupling schedule length, and data collection delay, by relaxing its precedence constraints. Our solution for this new problem involves the unconventional approach of constructing the schedule before finalizing the exact form of the data aggregation tree, which, in turn, requires that the schedule construction phase guarantees that every node can reach the sink. We compare our results using snapshot pipelining against a previously proposed algorithm that also uses a form of pipelining, as well as against an algorithm that though lacking pipelining, exhibits the ability to produce very short schedules. The results confirm the potential to achieve a substantial throughput increase, at the cost of some increase in latency.",none

Most UWC devices are battery-powered, where recharging/swapping batteries is not straightforward. Since the reliability of a UWC network depends on limited energy storage, energy-efficient communication is critical for its operation. Whilst communication range and data rate in UWC have been popular research topics, until recently, this energy-efficiency aspect of UWC has not received the same level of attention. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive literature review on existing contributions in the area of energy-efficient UWC. At first, we provide a detailed overview of UWC network architectures and relevant challenges for UWC networks. Next, we discuss and compare the most commonly-used UWC physical layer technologies, reviewing the existing physical layer power-saving techniques proposed in the literature.

Towards green machine learning for resource allocation in beyond 5G RAN slicing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.comnet.2023.109877,0,research-article,ACM,2023,"The new generation of mobile communications, 5G, has been rolled out. While basic features were successively implemented, more complex ones have been left aside for a new release. Such is the case of RAN slicing, which enables the division of a radio infrastructure into software-controlled logical networks. Among the technical difficulties is the radio resource allocation since slices can be attached to contract agreements with network performance targets, and the number of resources required to support the performance varies with the signal quality of the connected devices. Machine learning solutions can predict the number of radio resources needed based on the current state of the network. Our previous work, KPI-Converter, addressed this issue with densely connected neural networks. However, amid the current global energy crisis, we should focus on more green machine learning solutions that can achieve similar performance with much lower usage of computational resources. In this work, we present KPIC-Lite, a solution for resource allocation for RAN slicing that consumes 700 to 1000 times fewer resources than our previous work while performing similarly in most tested scenarios. We introduce a new asymmetric loss function that significantly boosts convergence compared to a-OMC, the state-of-the-art loss function for operator monetary costs.

The minimum backlog problem,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.tcs.2015.08.027,5,research-article,ACM,2015,"We study the minimum backlog problem (MBP). This online problem arises, e.g., in the context of sensor networks. We focus on two main variants of MBP.The discrete MBP is a 2-person game played on a graph G = ( V, E ) . The player is initially located at a vertex of the graph. In each time step, the adversary pours a total of one unit of water into cups that are located on the vertices of the graph, arbitrarily distributing the water among the cups. The player then moves from her current vertex to an adjacent vertex and empties the cup at that vertex. The player's objective is to minimize the backlog, i.e., the maximum amount of water in any cup at any time.The geometric MBP is a continuous-time version of the MBP: the cups are points in the two-dimensional plane, the adversary pours water continuously at a constant rate, and the player moves in the plane with unit speed. Again, the player's objective is to minimize the backlog.We show that the competitive ratio of any algorithm for the MBP has a lower bound of ( D ), where D is the diameter of the graph (for the discrete MBP) or the diameter of the point set (for the geometric MBP). Therefore we focus on determining a strategy for the player that guarantees a uniform upper bound on the absolute value of the backlog.For the absolute value of the backlog there is a trivial lower bound of ( D ), and the deamortization analysis of Dietz and Sleator gives an upper bound of O ( D log N ) for N cups. Our main result is a tight upper bound for the geometric MBP: we show that there is a strategy for the player that guarantees a backlog of O ( D ), independently of the number of cups.We also study a localized version of the discrete MBP: the adversary has a location within the graph and must act locally (filling cups) with respect to his position, just as the player acts locally (emptying cups) with respect to her position. We prove that deciding the value of this game is PSPACE-hard.",none

An image classification approach for hole detection in wireless sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11227-021-04276-4,0,research-article,ACM,2022,"Hole detection is a crucial task for monitoring the status of wireless sensor networks (WSN) which often consist of low-capability sensors. Holes can form in WSNs due to the problems during placement of the sensors or power/hardware failure. In these situations, sensing or transmitting data could be affected and can interrupt the normal operation of the WSNs. It may also decrease the lifetime of the network and sensing coverage of the sensors. The problem of hole detection is especially challenging in WSNs since the exact location of the sensors is often unknown. In this paper, we propose a novel hole detection approach called FD-CNN which is based on Force-directed (FD) Algorithm and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). In contrast to existing approaches, FD-CNN is a centralized approach and is able to detect holes from WSNs without relying on the information related to the location of the sensors. The proposed approach also alleviates the problem of high computational complexity in distributed approaches. The proposed approach accepts the network topology of a WSN as an input and generates the identity of the nodes surrounding each detected hole in the network as the final output. In the proposed approach, an FD algorithm is used to generate the layout of the wireless sensor networks followed by the identification of the holes in the layouts using a trained CNN model. In order to prepare labeled datasets for training the CNN model, an unsupervised pre-processing method is also proposed in this paper. After the holes are detected by the CNN model, two algorithms are proposed to identify the regions of the holes and corresponding nodes surrounding the regions. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed approach based on different datasets. Experimental results show that FD-CNN can achieve 80% sensitivity and 93% specificity in less than 2 minutes.",none

A Dynamic Threat Prevention Framework for Autonomous Vehicle Networks based on Ruin-theoretic Security Risk Assessment,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3660527,0,research-article,ACM,2024,"In recent years, Autonomous Vehicle Networks (AVNs) have gained significant attention for their potential to make transportation safer and more efficient.

However, V2V communication also introduces security vulnerabilities that can be exploited to compromise the safety and privacy of drivers and passengers. Malicious or selfish drivers can potentially intercept, modify, and manipulate V2V communication, causing confusion among vehicles or stealing sensitive data. Therefore, in order to identify and mitigate security threats that could jeopardize V2V communication in AVNs, the implementation of a threat prevention framework is imperative. This paper presents a threat prevention framework that assesses security risks dynamically to facilitate secure message forwarding in V2V communication. First, we propose a dynamic risk assessment technique that utilizes the PIER approach to evaluate the level of security threats posed to V2V communication, and ultimately generate a risk score. Second, we develop a security decay assessment method that utilizes ruin theory to continuously monitor security risk within the AVNs. Third, we design a risk-aware message forwarding protocol based on coalitional game theory to facilitate secure V2V communication. Our experiments using the simulator Veins demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of the proposed framework in preventing potential damage caused by common security threats and enhancing the security of the Automated Highway System (AHS).",none

Compressive network coding for wireless sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.comnet.2016.09.007,8,research-article,ACM,2016,"Considering the temporal and spatial correlations of sensor readings in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), this paper develops a clustered spatio-temporal compression scheme by integrating network coding (NC), compressed sensing (CS) and spatio-temporal compression for correlated data. The proper selection of NC coefficients and measurement matrix is investigated for this scheme. This design ensures successful reconstruction of original data with a considerably high probability and enables successful deployment of NC and CS in a real field. Moreover, in contrast to other spatio-temporal schemes with the same computational complexity, the proposed scheme possesses lower reconstruction error by employing independent encoding in each sensor node (including the cluster head nodes) and joint decoding in the sink node. In order to further reduce the reconstruction error, we construct a new optimization model of reconstruction error for the clustered spatio-temporal compression scheme. A distributed algorithm is developed to iteratively determine the optimal solution. Finally, simulation results verify that the clustered spatio-temporal compression scheme outperforms other two categories of compression schemes significantly in terms of recovery error and compression gain and the distributed algorithm converges to the optimal solution with a fast and stable speed.",none
An improved DECPSOHDV-Hop algorithm for node location of WSN in Cyber–Physical–Social-System,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.comcom.2022.05.008,1,research-article,ACM,2022,"Cyber-Physical Social System (CPSS) refers to the interaction between cyber-physical systems and social networks. The accuracy of information transmission in Cyber-Physical System is very important, and the information transmission of WSN node positioning occupies an important position. Aiming at the ubiquitous positioning accuracy and resource allocation problems in the node positioning, we propose an improved Chaotic Particle Swarm Optimization Hybrid Distance Vector Hopping Algorithm Based on Differential Evolution (DECPSOHDV-Hop) algorithm. This algorithm uses an improved algorithm parallel mechanism in the WSN node positioning, which can be more accurately positioned unknown node through dynamic optimization. In addition, when solving high-dimensional function optimization problems, particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms tend to converge prematurely and fall into local extremes. Therefore, based on the (DE)/current-to-best/1 operator, this paper proposes chaotic PSO algorithms of hybrid and parallel. For particle optimization in the difference operator, Gaussian/normal distribution is used for balance optimization. The hybrid method selects the basic particle swarm update strategy according to the probability, simplified the particle swarm update strategy or differential optimization to update the individual. The parallel method uses the improved model to update the Gaussian mutation operator of DE to update the entire population. In the simulation experiment results, the results of testing 20 high-dimensional benchmark functions show that compared with PSO and CPSO, the above two improved algorithms have better search accuracy and higher convergence speed, as well as the optimization results of the test function; In WSN node positioning, the positioning accuracy of the DECPSOHDV-Hop algorithm is as high as 90%, and the excellent positioning stability of the algorithm is verified from three different standards.",none
Burst-Aware Time-Triggered Flow Scheduling With Enhanced Multi-CQF in Time-Sensitive Networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TNET.2023.3264583,3,research-article,ACM,2023,"Deterministic transmission guarantee in time-sensitive networks (TSN) relies on queue models (such as CQF, TAS, ATS) and resource scheduling algorithms. Thanks to its ease of use, the CQF queue model has been widely adopted. However, the existing resource scheduling algorithms of CQF model only focus on periodic time-triggered (TT) flows without consideration of bursting flows. Considering that the bursting flows often carry high-priority data in real systems, in this paper we investigate the mixed-flow (i.e., TT and bursting flows) scheduling problem in CQF-based TSN aiming to maximize the number of schedulable flows and system load balance while satisfying the deterministic demands of delay, jitter, and reliability for both TT and bursting flows. Unfortunately, it is challenging to schedule the mixed flows with the original CQF model because of the huge difference between TT and bursting flows. To resolve this problem, we firstly design an enhanced Multi-CQF model to satisfy the basic demands of bursting flows sent at any time without affecting the deterministic transmission of TT flows. Given the complexity of mixed-flow scheduling and the proposed queue model, it is difficult for traditional algorithms to fully utilize network resources. Thus, we further propose a uline time-correlated uline DRL uline resource uline scheduling (TimeDRS) algorithm to optimize the resource allocation. TimeDRS can be extended to other time-related resource scheduling scenarios, such as TDMA-based scheduling. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approaches can greatly reduce frame loss and end-to-end latency for bursting flows, and well balance runtime and schedulability compared with state-of-the-art benchmarks.",none
Energy Consumption Evaluation of ZigBee Routing Protocols in IOT,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11277-022-10114-4,0,research-article,ACM,2023,"Currently, WSN is a critical component of the IoT environment that allows reliable data collection and delivery. WSN is a fast-paced network, a productive operation that can be used in the event of an emergency along with natural hazards, military forces, fires and asset tracking. In addition, the issues and issues affecting WSN are flexible shifts in topology without any static facilities and limited energy sources. Dynamic topology changes will result in existing data packets for each node, as will the reliability of the network.

Employing blockchain and IPFS in WSNs for malicious node detection and efficient data storage,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11276-023-03648-3,0,research-article,ACM,2024,"The presence of the malicious internet of things (IoT) devices in wireless sensor networks (WSNs), in the underlying work, is identified using a private blockchain and interplanetary file system (IPFS) based system. In the proposed model, the registration of IoT devices is being done via the IoT device manager. After registration, the IoT devices send a request to get services from the IoT device manager. At this stage, authentication is performed through a machine learning technique, known as logitboost (LB), which helps in identifying the IoT devices as malicious or legitimate. A verification report is forwarded to the IoT device manager upon detection. If the IoT device is found to be acting maliciously, it is penalized and vice versa. Thus, ensuring the IoT device manager provides the required service only to the legitimate IoT device. The data used in the proposed work is taken from the WSN dataset (WSN-DS), which is balanced via the synthetic minority oversampling technique. Additionally, the miner nodes’ verification is performed via verifiable byzantine fault tolerance (VBFT). Also, IPFS is used to store the transaction data being shared between the IoT devices.

Data ferries based compressive data gathering for wireless sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11276-017-1584-0,1,article,ACM,2019,"The latest research progress of the theory of compressive sensing (CS) over graphs makes it possible that the advantage of CS can be utilized by data ferries to gather data for wireless sensor networks.

Improvement of packet transmission scheduling and delivery rate in wireless Ad-Hoc networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.phycom.2022.101707,0,research-article,ACM,2022,"The principal purpose of Ad-Hoc wireless networks is to increase service efficiency in terms of transmission scheduling and packet transfer rate. The approaches that assume frame unicity to satisfy a given set of packets minimize the end-to-end delay. However, they do not guarantee a maximum packet delivery rate due to the difficulty of establishing robust paths for packet transfer across nodes deployed in the network, especially in a three-dimensional (3D) environment. The objective is to minimize the end-to-end delay by ensuring the maximum delivery of packets to their destinations. Furthermore, the signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio (SINR) model is considered to optimize transmission scheduling. In this paper, an optimal node coordinates optimization approach is proposed to extend two recently investigated schemes in the literature (S-RDSP and I-RDSP). The developed algorithms, named S-MPDR and I-MPDR, seek to reduce the end-to-end delay by delivering a collection of inserted packets over a 3D environment while also maximizing the delivery rate of these packets. Desirability functions are used to evaluate the network’s performance in various scenarios involving two different environments, Level 0 and Level 1. Numerical results demonstrate that the developed algorithms outperform both schemes in terms of end-to-end delay and packet delivery rate. In the Level 0 environment, the overall minimum delay and packet delivery rate scores provided by S-MPDR are increased by 28% and 88% compared to S-RDSP, respectively. In comparison, those provided by I-MPDR are increased by 24% and 16% compared to I-RDSP. Similarly, in the Level 1 environment, the scores provided by S-MPDR are increased by 25% and 100% compared to S-RDSP, respectively, while those provided by I-MPDR are increased by 23% and 25% compared to I-RDSP.",none
FQ-MEC: Fuzzy-Based Q-Learning Approach for Mobility-Aware Energy-Efficient Clustering in MANET,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1155/2021/8874632,0,research-article,ACM,2021,"Different schemes have been proposed for increasing network lifetime in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) where nodes move uncertainly in any direction. Mobility awareness and energy efficiency are two inescapable optimization problems in such networks. Clustering is an important technique to improve scalability and network lifetime, as it relies on grouping mobile nodes into logical subgroups, called clusters, to facilitate network management. One of the challenging issues in this domain is to design a real-time routing protocol that efficiently prolongs the network lifetime in MANET. In this paper, a novel fuzzy-based Q-learning approach for mobility-aware energy-efficient clustering (FQMEC) is proposed that relies on deciding the behavioral pattern of the nodes based on their stability and residual energy. Also, Chebyshev’s inequality principle is applied to get node connectivity for load balancing by taking history from the monitoring phase to increase the learning accuracy. Extensive simulations are performed using the NS-2 network simulator, and the proposed scheme is compared with reinforcement learning (RL).

A learning automata based scheduling solution to the dynamic point coverage problem in wireless sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.comnet.2010.03.014,15,article,ACM,2010,"The dynamic point coverage problem in wireless sensor networks is to detect some moving target points in the area of the network using as few sensor nodes as possible. One way to deal with this problem is to schedule sensor nodes in such a way that a node is activated only at the times a target point is in its sensing region. In this paper we propose SALA, a scheduling algorithm based on learning automata, to deal with the problem of dynamic point coverage. In SALA each node in the network is equipped with a set of learning automata. The learning automata residing in each node try to learn the maximum sleep duration for the node in such a way that the detection rate of target points by the node does not degrade dramatically. This is done using the information obtained about the movement patterns of target points while passing throughout the sensing region of the nodes. We consider two types of target points; events and moving objects. Events are assumed to occur periodically or based on a Poisson distribution and moving objects are assumed to have a static movement path which is repeated periodically with a randomly selected velocity. In order to show the performance of SALA, some experiments have been conducted. The experimental results show that SALA outperforms the existing methods such as LEACH, GAF, PEAS and PW in terms of energy consumption.",none
Hybrid multi-objective evolutionary meta-heuristics for a parallel machine scheduling problem with setup times and preferences,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.cie.2023.109675,0,research-article,ACM,2024,"Fabric dyeing is a vital production process of textile products. In the dyeing process, orders are scheduled to machines, and the sequence of jobs on a machine is crucial since the machines require washing out that depends on the type of consecutive orders. This washing out process is a significant cost factor of the dyeing process because of the chemicals used, which causes sequence dependent setup times. Also, the order of the products to be processed is important in terms of quality that depends on color and shade of the jobs. In this paper, two metaheuristics, namely a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) and multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D) are presented to solve the multi-objective scheduling problem for the dyeing process with sequence dependent setup times, in which the objectives are makespan, tardiness, total number of setups, color preference, and shade difference. Two different gene designs and corresponding feasible schedule generation methods — one heuristic based and one integer programming based, which are integrated within the metaheuristic framework, are proposed. Finally, proposed algorithms are compared based on single and multiple objective analysis.

The design of a spectrum sharing scheme for WSNs to enable coexistence with geographically collocated heterogeneous wireless systems having multiple parallel interfering channels is a persistent challenge. In this context, interference identification and channel ranking in terms of spectrum access opportunities are addressed in this paper. The goal is to develop a low complexity channel ranking algorithm from channel energy measurements at sensors when a packet-reception-ratio to signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio (PRR-SINR) interference model is unavailable at network initialization phase. The interference characterizing estimators, temporal occupancy and strength level of a channel, are proposed for interference identification. The effectiveness of the estimators is tested on a sensor platform at 2.4 GHz ISM band under interference from WLAN. Subsequently, the impact of the interference estimators on a channel quality from a receiver perspective is determined with a decision theoretic approach. The estimators are weighted according to their influence on the fitness of a channel and channel ranking is established. The proposed channel ranking achieves a significant gain over heuristic channel ranking (HCR) and gives an accurate interference profile of the channels.",none

E2IA-HWSN: Energy Efficient Dual Intelligent Agents based Data Gathering and Emergency Event Delivery in Heterogeneous WSN Enabled IoT,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11277-021-08904-3,0,research-article,ACM,2022,"Heterogeneous sensors are equipped with a limited battery source that is concerned with network lifetime problems. However, this problem can be tackled with the effective design of WSN-IoT by clustering and sleep scheduling mechanisms. This paper addresses this issue by presenting novel ideas involved in the WSN operations such as grid construction, cluster head selection, sleep scheduling, and data gathering by intelligent Agents (iAgents). An energy-efficient dual iAgents based Heterogeneous WSN (E2IA-HWSN) is proposed. iAgents are used in this paper to automatically collect the sensed data from IoT sensors. In this E2IA-HWSN, a 3 × 3 grid is built and each cell is sub-divided into four in which cluster heads (CH) are selected in each sub-division, followed by ring partitioning for selecting a CH present at the center. Multi-Objective Harris Hawks optimization (MO-HHO) algorithm is used to select CH and supernode, here to minimize the energy consumption of CH, the supernode takes responsibility to assign sleep schedules to devices. The scheduling slots are assigned only after a sensor reaches below the energy threshold. For scheduling, the Bayes rule-based Markov model (BR-MM) is applied with the determination of residual energy and sensed packet counts. Generator de Bits Pseudo Aleatorios (GBPA) eliminates redundant data in CH and then inter-cluster routing is performed in case of emergency events. If not, then the CH waits for the arrival of iagents, the trajectory of iAgents is dynamically predicted with Deep Policy Gradient (DDPG).

Processing continuous top-k data collection queries in lifetime-constrained wireless sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1968613.1968631,2,research-article,ACM,2011,"We study the processing of continuous top-k data collection (CTKDC) queries in lifetime-constrained wireless sensor networks. A query of this type continuously collects a list of k highest sensor readings into the base station in every epoch and reports to the user. So far, algorithms proposed to process these queries conventionally assume that k is a fixed number and then try to reduce the energy consumption of the sensor nodes or to maximize the lifetime of the network. However, in many practical monitoring applications, the most important user requirement is that the network can collect sensor data effectively for at least a designated amount of time while the value of k can be changed flexibly and only needs to be as high as possible. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an adaptive algorithm to process CTKDC queries in lifetime-constrained wireless sensor networks. Our algorithm works proactively at the sensor nodes and guides each sensor node to compute adaptively the amount of sensor data that it should send to the base station in each sampling interval. By controlling carefully the amounts of sensor data sent, and thus the cost of message transmissions, all sensor nodes together both make sure that the network will run until when the lifetime constraint is satisfied, and maximize the amount of top-k data reported to the user. Through experimental results, we show that the proposed algorithm can effectively ensure the network lifetime requirements when processing CTKDC queries. Moreover, the average amount of top-k data collected by this algorithm in a sampling interval is very close to the one obtained by the offline optimal algorithm in which all sensor readings are assumed to be known a priori.",none

The greatest risk with the use of WSNs in critical infrastructure is their vulnerability to malicious network level attacks. Their radio communication network can be disrupted, causing them to lose or delay data which will compromise system functionality. This paper presents Antilizer, a lightweight, fully-distributed solution to enable WSNs to detect and recover from common network level attack scenarios. In Antilizer each sensor node builds a self-referenced trust model of its neighbourhood using network overhearing. The node uses the trust model to autonomously adapt its communication decisions. In the case of a network attack, a node can make neighbour collaboration routing decisions to avoid affected regions of the network. Mobile agents further bound the damage caused by attacks. These agents enable a simple notification scheme which propagates collaborative decisions from the nodes to the base station. A filtering mechanism at the base station further validates the authenticity of the information shared by mobile agents. We evaluate Antilizer in simulation against several routing attacks.

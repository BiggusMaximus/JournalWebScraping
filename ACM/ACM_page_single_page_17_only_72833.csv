An Energy Efficient Stable Clustering Approach Using Fuzzy Type-2 Bat Flower Pollinator for Wireless Sensor Networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11277-020-07094-8,2,research-article,ACM,2020,"Wireless sensor network (WSN) is a cost-effective networking solution for information updating in the coverage radius or in the sensing region. To record a real time event, large number of sensor nodes (SNs) need to be arranged systematically, such that information collection is possible for longer span of time. But, the hurdle faced by WSN is the limited resources of SNs. Hence, there is high demand to design and implement an energy efficient scheme to prolong the operational lifetime of WSN. Clustering based routing is the most suitable approach to support for load balancing, fault tolerance, and reliable communication to prolong performance parameters of WSN. These performance parameters are achieved at the cost of reduced lifetime of cluster head (CH). To overcome such limitations in clustering based hierarchical approach, efficient CH selection algorithm, and optimized routing algorithm are essential to design efficient solution for larger scale networks. In this paper, bat flower pollinator (BFP) using fuzzy type-2 based clustering approach is proposed to enhance the network lifespan. Simulation outcomes show that the proposed algorithm outperforms competitive clustering algorithms in the context of energy consumption, stability period and system lifetime.",none
A Distributed Scheduling Algorithm for IEEE 802.15.4e Wireless Sensor Networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.csi.2017.01.003,8,research-article,ACM,2017,"As the widely adopted IEEE 802.15.4 standard exhibited severe drawbacks when used in multi-hop WSN environment, the IEEE Standards Association Board has released a revised version, IEEE 802.15.4e, which includes Time-Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) mechanism as the MAC amendment to IEEE 802.15.4. The key feature of IEEE 802.15.4e TSCH mechanism is to allow the sensors to plan the time-slot schedule for efficient data transmission. However, the standard does not specify how to plan a time-slot schedule so that data collected by the sensors can be received by the base station as soon as possible without being delayed by transmission conflicts. In this paper, we propose a constant-time, distributed time-slot scheduling algorithm to address this problem. Existing works on IEEE 802.15.4e TSCH scheduling depend on one or a few nodes to collect traffic-flow information from their descendants and plan a centralized time-slot schedule for the whole network. In contrast, our algorithm allows every sensor node to compute its time-slot schedule in a simple, truly distributed manner. Simulation results show that our algorithm significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art protocol in terms of the packet transmission delay and yields a smaller duty cycle. HighlightsThe current state of the art of IEEE 802.15.4e standard is reviewed.The minimum TSCH schedule for conflict-free data gathering process in an IEEE 802.15.4e WSN is shown to be NP-hard.A constant-time, distributed scheduling algorithm to address the minimum IEEE 802.15.4e TSCH scheduling problem is proposed.",none
Machine learning based volatile block chain construction for secure routing in decentralized military sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11276-021-02748-2,7,research-article,ACM,2021,"Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) contain multiple wireless sensor nodes deployed around the geographical locations. The WSN used in military applications need more security and hence the deployment of trustworthy nodes and links in WSN provides more secure data transmission in Decentralized Military Sensor Networks (DMSNs). Moreover, the DMSNs work with different set of significance constraints including higher security requirements. The design of DMSNs targets surveillance tasks, intruder tracking tasks, army resource maintenance tasks and communication security requirements. Therefore, building a secure and dynamic DMSN against multiple threats is a challenging task. In addition, security principles developed for DMSN cause excessive energy consumption. Moreover, DMSN has completely open distributed architecture without having any base stations. Under this situation, the need for effective and secured data communication can be achieved with the help of a secure routing protocol. Block chains are generally used for making secure financial transactions. However, the routing protocols used in DMSN can support autonomous routing transactions from one node to other node. In this situation, block chain enabled routing procedures can ensure the trustworthiness of any data that is forwarded through different sensor nodes. Hence, a new Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) based Block Chain enabled secured Routing Protocol (GBCRP) is proposed in this paper which authenticates and validates the ongoing routing procedures of DMSN. Moreover, a new intrusion detection system is also proposed in this work using GAN which is deployed in the nodes of the DMSN for enhancing the security of communication. Since block chain based routing protocols do not provide security, the GBCRP works for creating volatile block chains using decentralized authentication principles and effective intrusion detection. The proposed system uses a Fully Decentralized Generative Adversarial Network (FDGAN) for monitoring the secure routing transactions by the development of an intrusion detection system. The results obtained from this work show that the proposed GBCRP providing better secured routing compared to the existing systems with respect to security, energy consumption and routing metrics.",none
Combining simulated annealing with Lagrangian relaxation and weighted Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition for integrated design decisions in wireless sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.cor.2015.02.001,4,research-article,ACM,2015,"A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is the outcome of the collaborative effort of multi-functional, low-power, low-cost, tiny electronic devices called sensors. Their ability to work autonomously provides a distributed environment capable to monitor even remote or inaccessible areas, which explains the wide application range of WSNs. There are four main issues in the design of a WSN: determining sensor locations (deployment), scheduling sensors, finding sink locations, and obtaining sensor-to-sink data routes. Sensors have very limited energy resources and their efficient management becomes critical for elongating network lifetime. As a result, most of the works on optimal WSN design are concerned with efficient energy usage. Unfortunately, only a few of them use an integrated approach and try to address these four issues simultaneously. In this work we also follow this line of research and develop first a monolithic mixed-integer linear programming model that maximizes network lifetime by optimally determining sensor and sink locations, sensor-to-sink data flows, active and stand-by periods of the sensors subject to data flow conservation, energy consumption and budget usage constraints. Then we propose a nested solution method consisting of two procedures: simulated annealing that performs search for the best sink locations in the outer level and Lagrangian relaxation based heuristic employed with weighted Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition for the multiplier update in the inner level, which determines sensor locations, activity schedules of the sensors and data flows routes. We demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the new approach on randomly generated instances by extensive numerical experiments.",none
Method for Effectively Utilizing Node Energy of WSN for Coal Mine Robot,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1155/2018/1487908,0,research-article,ACM,2018,"As a special application scenario, the data collected by wireless sensor networks of coal mine robot is from vital and dangerous environment.

The method takes many factors into account, such as the hop number, distance, residual energy, and node communication loss and energy. Each node of the wireless sensor networks is mapped into an Agent. Periodic training is carried out to optimize the route choice. Each Agent chooses the optimal path for data transmission according to the calculated Q evaluation value. Simulation results show that the self-organizing sensor networks using Q-learning can balance the energy consumption of the nodes and prolong the lifetime of the networks.",none
Multi-objective Global Path Planning for UAV-assisted Sensor Data Collection Using DRL and Transformer,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/978-3-031-25198-6_37,0,Article,ACM,2023,"Unmanned-Aerial-Vehicles’ (UAVs) inherent features such as high dynamicity, quick deployment, and line of sight communication have motivated the research of UAV-assisted IoT networks. In such networks, one critical issue is path planing scheduling, which unfortunately is a complex multi-objective optimization problem (MOP). Although there exist extensive traditional MOP algorithms, the efficiency is unacceptable due to the resource constrains and they are unscalable for dynamic scenarios. In order to achieve a more efficient yet scalable multi-objective path planing algorithm, we innovatively propose a framework integrating deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and transformer. We firstly decompose the MOP problem into a series of sequencing subproblems with weighted objectives, and then we present a modified transformer network to solve each sequencing subproblem and further a DRL algorithm to facilitate the subproblem network training.

RDA-BWO: hybrid energy efficient data transfer and mobile sink location prediction in heterogeneous WSN,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11276-021-02678-z,2,research-article,ACM,2021,"WSN (Wireless Sensor Network) is an emerging and exigent technology being used in various applications such as health monitoring, GPS tracking, security, environmental monitoring etc. The energy resource of WSN is limited because of the reduced battery power. Also, it is difficult for the sensor nodes in WSN to recharge their batteries in hostile environments. Therefore, the idea of heterogeneous WSN (H-WSN) is introduced in this work which offers extra energy to the nodes based on energy heterogeneity. Here, a hybrid RDA-BWO (Red Deer Algorithm-Black Widow Optimization) method is presented to perform energy efficient data transfer. Multiple Mobile Sinks (MMSs) are employed in the network to avoid multi-hop communication among CHs and sink. In H-WSN, energy efficient data transfer and MSLP (Mobile Sink Location Prediction) with MMSs integrates the strategies namely FCM (Fuzzy C Means) clustering, RDA based CH (Cluster Head) selection, Data collection and aggregation mechanism, BWO based MSLP, hot-spot elimination and MSTP (Mobile Sink Traversal Path). The entire H-WSN is clustered using FCM algorithm. The CH selection make use of distance parameter, residual energy, average energy, number of node neighbours and ECR (Energy Consumption Rate) for the proposed energy efficacy. The proposed H-WSN is implemented in NS2 platform. Simulation results outperform the baseline protocols on different metrics, such as throughput, network lifetime, network’s residual energy, number of dead nodes, stability period, and number of alive nodes demonstrate the superiority of the proposed RDA-BWO method.",none
Reward-based residential wireless sensor optimization approach for appliance monitoring,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s00500-020-05525-z,0,research-article,ACM,2021,"Sensor network-based home automation systems are familiar over the recent decades. Incorporating the benefits of the sensor network, energy management systems (EMS), is introduced to benefit end-user through periodic information sharing and remote access. WSN opted for energy harvesters to reduce the maintenance costs and maximize the lifetime of network. It is a perfect match for wireless devices and WSNs. Energy management system designed for effective use of harvested energy. Wireless sensor networks (WSN) coupled with EMS and grid-based applications serve as a support for smart home appliances. The integrated system architectures are cost effective and are energy harvesting that is profitable for end-user applications. Identifying optimal devices and defining an energy management policy are a tedious task as the devices are interfaced through different application support. This manuscript proposes a reward-based energy harvesting (REH) approach for identifying reliable devices in order to frame minimal-allocation energy for its operation. The rewards for the devices are estimated through observations carried out using reinforced learning that determines the operation state of the device. The reward function is computed using a variant function evaluated using the enduring energy and storage metrics of a device. Unlike the other learning methods, this approach operates in variable communication interval retaining the reward from the previous history of the devices. With a distributed WSN support and recursive knowledge of the sensor devices, REH is intended to improve the energy conservation rate with lesser retransmissions. The curtailed number of retransmissions minimizes delay with more preferable ideal devices in a home management system. The performance of the proposed REH is evaluated through simulations considering the following metrics: end-to-end delay, energy utilization, packets forwarded, expected TTL and number of retransmissions.",none
An Efficient Delay Centric Speed and Directional Routing (DMDR) for Improved Routing in MANET,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s42979-023-02562-x,0,research-article,ACM,2024,"Routing in Mobile Ad hoc Network (MANET) has been well studied, and there exists number of approaches in literature, which consider mobility speed, latency, and hop count in routing the network packets. However, they suffer to achieve higher QoS performance in routing. To handle this issue, an efficient Delay Centric Speed and Directional Routing (DMDR) is presented in this article. The method considers the factors like delay between k neighbors and mobility speed of nodes with its direction in the selection of transmission route. Initially, the method discovers the routes available toward the destination and computes Delay Sensitive Route Support (DSRS) which represents the suitability of route to deliver the packet on time, Mobility-Based Transmission Support (MTS) which represents the availability of the route according to the speed of node, and Directional Reaching Support (DRS) which represents the number of nodes in the future location to reach the destination. According to the DSRS, MTS, and DRS values, the value of Effective Transmission Score (ETS) is measured for different routes. Most suitable route has been selected based on ETS value. By measuring the DSRS value at k hops in the route, the method identifies the least latency route to maximize the QoS performance.",none

Neural Network Clustering and Swarm Intelligence-Based Routing Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks: A Machine Learning Perspective,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1155/2023/4758852,0,research-article,ACM,2023,"With no requirement for an established network infrastructure, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are well suited for applications that call for quick network deployment. Military training and emergency rescue operations are two prominent uses of WSNs. The individual network nodes must carry out routing and intrusion detection because there is no predetermined routing or intrusion detection in a wireless network. WSNs can only manage a certain volume of data, and doing so requires a significant amount of energy to process, transmit, and receive. Since sensors have a modest energy source and a constrained bandwidth, they cannot transmit all of their data to a base station for processing and analysis. Therefore, machine learning (ML) techniques are needed for WSNs to facilitate data transmission. Other current solutions have drawbacks as well, such as being less reliable, more susceptible to environmental changes, converging more slowly, and having shorter network lifetimes. This study addressed problems with wireless sensor networks and devised an efficient clustering and routing algorithm based on machine learning.

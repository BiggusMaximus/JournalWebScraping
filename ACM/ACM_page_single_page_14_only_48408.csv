QoS aware routing in body-to-body network for emergency medical care: issues and challenges,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1504/ijwmc.2019.101420,0,research-article,ACM,2019,"With the increase in frequencies and unpredictability of disasters worldwide, there is a necessity for novel ubiquitous communication systems enabling Emergency Medical Care (EMC) at the disaster site for e-triaging of the victims. It is necessary to give importance to the transmission of critical victims' data as opposed to non-critical victims' data, over the deployed communication system towards the medical caretaker at the disaster site. This needs the requirement of medical condition aware Quality-of-Service (QoS) support for the transmission of the heterogeneous type of medical data. This paper proposes the deployment of Body-to-Body network (BBN/B2B) to transmit medical data towards the healthcare professionals to perform e-triaging. Further, the paper focuses on the importance of medical condition aware probabilistic and differentiated flow specific and network-specific QoS support at BBN to improve the quality and speediness of the e-triage by analysing design criteria required by the routing protocol for BBN at EMC.

DeepGANTT: A Scalable Deep Learning Scheduler for Backscatter Networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3583120.3586957,0,research-article,ACM,2023,"Novel backscatter communication techniques enable battery-free sensor tags to interoperate with unmodified standard IoT devices, extending a sensor network’s capabilities in a scalable manner. Without requiring additional dedicated infrastructure, the battery-free tags harvest energy from the environment, while the IoT devices provide them with the unmodulated carrier they need to communicate. A schedule coordinates the provision of carriers for the communications of battery-free devices with IoT nodes. Optimal carrier scheduling is an NP-hard problem that limits the scalability of network deployments. Thus, existing solutions waste energy and other valuable resources by scheduling the carriers suboptimally. We present DeepGANTT, a deep learning scheduler that leverages graph neural networks to efficiently provide near-optimal carrier scheduling. We train our scheduler with optimal schedules of relatively small networks obtained from a constraint optimization solver, achieving a performance within 3% of the optimum. Without the need to retrain, our scheduler generalizes to networks 6 × larger in the number of nodes and 10 × larger in the number of tags than those used for training. DeepGANTT breaks the scalability limitations of the optimal scheduler and reduces carrier utilization by up to compared to the state-of-the-art heuristic. As a consequence, our scheduler efficiently reduces energy and spectrum utilization in backscatter networks.",none
Fast Data Collection in Tree-Based Wireless Sensor Networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TMC.2011.22,58,research-article,ACM,2012,"We investigate the following fundamental question—how fast can information be collected from a wireless sensor network organized as tree? To address this, we explore and evaluate a number of different techniques using realistic simulation models under the many-to-one communication paradigm known as convergecast. We first consider time scheduling on a single frequency channel with the aim of minimizing the number of time slots required (schedule length) to complete a convergecast. Next, we combine scheduling with transmission power control to mitigate the effects of interference, and show that while power control helps in reducing the schedule length under a single frequency, scheduling transmissions using multiple frequencies is more efficient. We give lower bounds on the schedule length when interference is completely eliminated, and propose algorithms that achieve these bounds. We also evaluate the performance of various channel assignment methods and find empirically that for moderate size networks of about 100 nodes, the use of multifrequency scheduling can suffice to eliminate most of the interference. Then, the data collection rate no longer remains limited by interference but by the topology of the routing tree. To this end, we construct degree-constrained spanning trees and capacitated minimal spanning trees, and show significant improvement in scheduling performance over different deployment densities. Lastly, we evaluate the impact of different interference and channel models on the schedule length.",none

In Software-Defined Wireless Sensor Networks (SDWSNs), security and energy are two critical issues. However, few studies address these two aspects simultaneously. In this paper, we propose an Energy-efficient Trust Management and Routing Mechanism (ETMRM) for SDWSNs to handle the malicious forwarding attacks, such as selective forwarding attack and new-flow attack. In the ETMRM, we firstly extend the SensorFlow tables to realize a light-weight trust monitoring and evaluation scheme at the node level, and propose a centralized trust management scheme at the controller level to detect and isolate the malicious nodes based on the trust information collected from sensor nodes. Secondly, we present an energy-efficient report message aggregating scheme for aggregation points’ selection to save energy and ensure the transmission of control traffic. Thirdly, we present a trust routing mechanism jointly considering the node’s residual energy and trust level to guarantee the transmission of data traffic.

SIMOF: swarm intelligence multi-objective fuzzy thermal-aware routing protocol for WBANs,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11227-023-05102-9,0,research-article,ACM,2023,"Wireless body area network (WBAN) is a wireless communication technology which facilitates the medical staff to remotely monitor and provide accurate treatment to patients. Wireless body sensors are resource constrained, and consequently, an efficient routing protocol is vital in the design of these networks. Although many protocols have been presented for the routing in WBANs, sufficient features have not been adequately addressed in these techniques. Moreover, parameters of these protocols are manually set and remain constant in all applications, i.e., no automatic tuning procedure is applied to tune the protocol based on the application requirements. To overcome these drawbacks, we introduce a swarm intelligence multi-objective fuzzy protocol (named SIMOF), as a tunable routing protocol in WBANs. The SIMOF comprises two phases, namely fuzzy inference system (FIS) and automatic rule tuning using whale optimization algorithm (WOA). The FIS utilizes a multi-objective fuzzy inference system based on residual energy, distance, reliability, bandwidth, temperature, path loss, and estimated energy consumption, to select proper relay nodes, considering IEEE 802.15.6 standard.

A framework for Resource-Aware Data Accumulation in sparse wireless sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.comcom.2011.06.010,5,article,ACM,2011,"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have become an enabling technology for a wide range of applications. In contrast with traditional scenarios where static sensor nodes are densely deployed, a sparse WSN architecture can also be used in many cases. In a sparse WSN, special mobile data collectors (MDCs) are used to gather data from ordinary sensor nodes. In general, sensor nodes do not know when they will be in contact with the MDC, hence they need to discover its presence in their communication range. To this end, discovery mechanisms based on periodic listening and a duty-cycle have shown to be effective in reducing the energy consumption of sensor nodes. However, if not properly tuned, such mechanisms can hinder the data collection process. In this paper, we introduce a Resource-Aware Data Accumulation (RADA), a novel and lightweight framework which allows nodes to learn the MDC arrival pattern, and tune the discovery duty-cycle accordingly. Furthermore, RADA is able to adapt to changes in the operating conditions, and is capable of effectively supporting a number of different MDC mobility patterns.

In this article we introduce the problem of preserving the privacy of clients querying a wireless sensor network owned by untrusted organizations. We first propose an efficient protocol, SPYC, that ensures full client privacy in settings where the servers providing access to the network are honest-but-curious and whose collaboration does not extend beyond well-defined administrative purposes. Furthermore, we study the same query privacy problem in a setting where servers exhibit malicious behavior or where powerful external attackers have access to sensor network traffic information. In this setting we propose two metrics for quantifying the privacy achieved by a client's query sequence. We then extend SPYC with a suite of practical algorithms, then analyze the privacy and efficiency levels they provide. Our TOSSIM simulations show that the proposed extensions are communication efficient while significantly improving client privacy levels.",none
Simulated annealing and genetic algorithm-based hybrid approach for energy-aware clustered routing in large-range multi-sink wireless sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1504/ijahuc.2020.109800,1,research-article,ACM,2020,"In recent years, the researchers have got progressively more interest in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) as it plays a vital role in numerous applications. WSNs have strict resource constraints such as limited bandwidth, limited energy, limited processing capability, and limited memory. Among them, the most critical one is limited energy. So, energy efficiency has got significant importance in the WSNs. Energy consumption is mainly due to computation and communication between sensor nodes and the base station. Energy consumption for communication is more when compared to computation. Hence it is indispensable to focus on designing an energy-efficient routing for WSN. In this paper, a cluster-based routing using simulated annealing and genetic algorithm-based hybrid (SAGA-H) approach has been proposed. The proposed approach is explained and simulated using MATLAB. Further, the results observed have been compared with existing GA-based approach with respect to network lifetime, the number of packets sent to BS and sink, and average residual energy. From the simulation results, it is observed that the proposed approach outperforms the existing GA-based approach.",none

Schedule-based multi-channel communication in wireless sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.adhoc.2014.11.008,12,research-article,ACM,2015,"Recently, wireless sensor networks (WSNs), enabling the connection between the physical world and the digital world, have become an important component of the Internet of Things (IoT). Several applications in the IoT require the efficient and timely collection of larger amounts of data. Due to the interference and contention over the wireless medium, the limited bandwidth of the radios, the limited resources of the battery-operated sensor nodes, this requirement becomes a challenging task. In this research, we exploit the multi-channel operation capability of the radios to provide the higher network throughput and propose an efficient scheduling algorithm to eliminate collision, idle-listening or over-hearing, which are consequences of non-coordinated transmissions. Our work focuses on scheduling the regular traffic that is periodically transmitted and on adapting the schedule to the additional traffic that can be requested at some point in time. To deploy the schedule-based multi-channel protocol on real applications, we design the complete communication procedure that is necessary for sensor nodes to communicate among them to form a network and to propagate the sensed data to the collection point. We also propose a low-overhead time synchronization scheme that is critical for a schedule-based protocol. The results of extensive simulation experiments show that the proposed scheduling algorithm can achieve collision-free parallel transmissions over different channels to provide high throughput and high delivery ratio while meeting the crucial energy efficiency requirements. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of the protocol and the time synchronization scheme on a laboratory-scaled test-bed of real motes.",none

DIGEST: a decentralized divergecast scheduling algorithm for IEEE 802.15.4e TSCH in the internet of things,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11276-021-02722-y,0,research-article,ACM,2021,"Internet of Things is emerging as a commercial phenomenon. It is conjectured that billions of appliances will be connected within the current Internet infrastructure by 2020. These networked appliances require low-power radio and reliability. Hence, IEEE brought up a very efficient, reliable and deterministic time-frequency enabled medium access control protocol, IEEE 802.15.4e time slotted channel hopping (TSCH), on top of low power IEEE 802.15.4 radio for the industrial market. IEEE 802.15.4e TSCH is able to run a communication schedule for MAC upon a communication schedule is built. However, the issue of how such scheduling will be made, updated, and maintained is beyond the scope of the IEEE 802.15.4e TSCH standard. The unit responsible for these tasks is also out of its scope. That means, required scheduling mechanism is absent in this standard. In order to complete this gap, several communication scheduling algorithms are introduced in the literature. In this study, we first introduce another decentralized divergecast communication scheduling algorithm, called as DIGEST, where divergecast implies that network traffic moves in any directions opposed to convergecast where network traffic moves from leave nodes to root. That DIGEST algorithm tries to schedule time slots by selecting a neighbor node at first. When choosing a neighbor node, it tries to make almost equal number of dedicated time slots to each neighbor. In this way, it can provide better schedules with neighbor nodes than other scheduling algorithms. We evaluate the effectiveness of DIGEST, Diva, and Berkeley’s Aloha-based scheduling algorithms under static and mobile environments by running extensive simulations. Our simulation results indicate that the DIGEST algorithm is superior to the others in terms of the neighbor connectivity ratio.",none
Optimal beamsteering on D2D mmWave transmitters by employing general benders decomposition,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11276-021-02763-3,0,research-article,ACM,2021,"The implementation of beamforming schemes on the base station side has been widely employed in recent communication networks.

GD3N: Adaptive clustering-based detection of selective forwarding attacks in WSNs under variable harsh environments,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.ins.2024.120375,0,research-article,ACM,2024,"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are susceptible to numerous security threats due to their reliance on open environments and broadcast communication methods. Among these, the selective forwarding attack is notably challenging to detect. This difficulty arises from the ability of malicious nodes to imitate the behavior of normal nodes, and selectively drop data packets, which makes them virtually indistinguishable from normal ones, particularly under conditions of poor channel quality. To address this challenge with harsh environments, we introduce a novel methodology termed GD3N. This approach is underpinned by the design of a unique type of data point that encapsulates both short-term and long-term forwarding behaviors of nodes. It combines a refined version of the Gradient Diffusion Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (GD-DBSCAN) algorithm, with a novel Double-Parameter Neighbor Voting (DP-NV) method based on the data set. These innovations contribute to a significant enhancement in detection accuracy and a reduction in computational complexity when compared to traditional DBSCAN and NV methods. Simulation results show that our GD3N achieves a false detection rate (FDR) of less than 2%, a missed detection rate (MDR) of below 10%, and an overall detection accuracy rate (DAR) of over 95% across various testing scenarios.Highlights•Introduce a new kind of data point representing both long and short term behaviors of the nodes.•The simplified GD-DBSCAN algorithm utilizes only one parameter to divide nodes into suspicious and normal.•The optimized DP-NV provides a parameter-free mechanism to protect normal nodes from being misjudged.",none

Blockchain-Based Secure Localization against Malicious Nodes in IoT-Based Wireless Sensor Networks Using Federated Learning,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1155/2023/8068038,2,research-article,ACM,2023,"Wireless sensor networks are the core of the Internet of Things and are used in healthcare, locations, the military, and security. Threats to the security of wireless sensor networks built on the Internet of Things (IoT-WSNs) can come from a variety of sources. This study proposes secure attack localization and detection in IoT-WSNs to improve security and service delivery. The technique used blockchain-based cascade encryption and trust evaluation in a hierarchical design to generate blockchain trust values before beacon nodes broadcast data to the base station. Simulation results reveal that cascading encryption and feature assessment measure the trust value of nodes by rewarding each other for service provisioning and trust by removing malicious nodes that reduce localization accuracy and quality of service in the network. Federated machine learning improves data security and transmission by merging raw device data and placing malicious threats in the blockchain.

CL-MAC: A Cross-Layer MAC protocol for heterogeneous Wireless Sensor Networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.adhoc.2012.05.005,9,article,ACM,2013,"In duty cycled MAC protocols, multi-packet, multi-flow and multi-hop traffic patterns experience significant latencies, which are partially due to duty cycling. Several cross-layer routing/MAC schemes have been proposed to mitigate this latency. However, they utilize routing information from a single flow and/or a single packet perspective, thus limiting their adaptation to varying traffic loads and patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel Cross-Layer MAC protocol (CL-MAC) for WSNs, to efficiently handle multi-packet, multi-hop and multi-flow traffic patterns while adapting to a wide range of traffic loads. CL-MAC's scheduling is based on a unique structure of flow setup packets that efficiently utilize routing information to transmit multiple data packets over multiple multi-hop flows. Unlike other MAC protocols, supporting construction of multi-hop flows, CL-MAC considers all pending packets in the routing layer buffer and all flow setup requests from neighbors, when setting up a flow. This allows CL-MAC to make more informed scheduling decisions, reflecting the current network status, and dynamically optimize its scheduling mechanism accordingly. We evaluate CL-MAC through extensive ns-2 simulations and compare its performance to the state of the art, over various networks and for a wide variety of traffic loads and patterns. In all our experiments, CL-MAC substantially reduces end-to-end latency, increases delivery ratio while reducing the average energy consumed per packet delivered.",none

This protocol operates at the network layer and can create routing and optimally distribute routing information between nodes. RPL is a low-power, high-throughput IPv6 routing protocol that uses distance vectors. Each sensor-to-wire network router has a collection of fixed parents and a preferred parent on the path to the Destination-oriented directed acyclic graph (DODAG) graph’s root in steady-state. Each router part of the graph sends DODAG information object (DIO) control messages and specifies its rank within the graph, indicating its position within the network relative to the root. When a node receives a DIO message, it determines its network rank, which must be higher than all its parents’ rank, and then continues sending DIO messages using the trickle timer. As a result, DODAG begins at the root and eventually extends to encompass the whole network. This paper is the first review to study intrusion detection systems in the RPL protocol based on machine learning (ML) techniques to the best of our knowledge.

LT Codes and the Minimum Spanning Tree Based Distributed Storage in Wireless Sensor Networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11036-018-1173-1,0,research-article,ACM,2022,"In wireless sensor networks, sensor nodes are vulnerable due to the challenging environment and limited energy. Once a sensor node fails, the stored sensed data will be lost. In this paper, we develop a distributed algorithm for solving this problem based on the fountain codes and the minimum spanning tree. Similar to previous works, we adopt the Luby Transform (LT) codes, the first practical scheme of fountain codes, in our algorithm. However, different from the previous schemes, our algorithm deploys the minimum spanning tree instead of the random walk. Due to the fact that all nodes in the wireless sensor networks do not have the location information of other nodes, we use the Gallager-Humble-Spira (GHS) algorithm to generate a distributed minimum spanning tree. Data packets can be transmitted through the tree and easily reach every node in the network. We obtain the performance of the algorithm through simulations, which show that our algorithm consumes less number of the transmissions compared with the existing algorithms using the random walk.",none
Distributed Multilevel k-Coverage Energy-Efficient Fault-Tolerant Scheduling for Wireless Sensor Networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11277-022-09495-3,0,research-article,ACM,2022,"The expected k-coverage, prolonged network lifetime, and fault-tolerance capabilities play a vital role in the success of various application operations in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), as they are the key performance indicators of WSNs. The k-coverage protocol ensures that the entire target region of interest (R) is the whole k-covered, where R can further be distributed into several target subregions. The distribution of target subregions is based on the field’s vulnerability. The value of k is higher for subregions with higher vulnerability. More explicitly, some applications request a high level of k-coverage for a portion of R that is highly vulnerable; such applications never demand a flat k-coverage for their entire R. Thus, more sensors have to be unnecessarily active to provide a flat k-coverage. Some of the sensors stop working before their expected battery lifetime, due to which the network’s overall lifetime and functionality are influenced. Therefore, instead of flat k-coverage scheduling, we propose a distributed multilevel k-coverage, energy-efficient, and fault-tolerant scheduling protocol (named DkCEFS). The average time and the communication overhead of DkCEFS is O(nlogn). Simulation results proves that DkCEFS maintain the multilevel k-coverage ratio up to 40–45% compared to flat k-coverage and prolonging the average network lifetime up to 30–40% more with fault-tolerance capabilities. We also analyzed that distributed multilevel k-coverage conserve more energy than a distribution of a flat k-coverage in a stipulated network lifetime. The proof of correctness and simulation comparisons-results are presented to validate the proposed protocol’s effectiveness.",none
Intelligent Networking for Energy Harvesting Powered IoT Systems,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3638765,0,research-article,ACM,2024,"As the next-generation battery substitute for IoT system, energy harvesting (EH) technology revolutionizes the IoT industry with environmental friendliness, ubiquitous accessibility, and sustainability, which enables various self-sustaining IoT applications. However, due to the weak and intermittent nature of EH power, the performance of EH-powered IoT systems as well as its collaborative routing mechanism can severely deteriorate, rendering unpleasant data package loss during each power failure. Such a phenomenon makes conventional routing policies and energy allocation strategies impractical. Given the complexity of the problem, reinforcement learning (RL) appears to be one of the most promising and applicable methods to address this challenge. Nevertheless, although the energy allocation and routing policy are jointly optimized by the RL method, due to the energy restriction of EH devices, the inappropriate configuration of multi-hop network topology severely degrades the data collection performance. Therefore, this article first conducts a thorough mathematical discussion and develops the topology design and validation algorithm under energy harvesting scenarios. Then, this article develops DeepIoTRouting, a distributed and scalable deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach, to address the routing and energy allocation jointly for the energy harvesting powered distributed IoT system. The experimental results show that with topology optimization, DeepIoTRouting achieves at least 38.71% improvement on the amount of data delivery to sink in a 20-device IoT network, which significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",none
Multi-level trust-based secure and optimal IoT-WSN routing for environmental monitoring applications,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11227-023-05875-z,0,research-article,ACM,2024,"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are a critical component of the Internet of Things (IoT) which can be used in various fields, including environmental monitoring, smart agriculture, etc. However, WSNs used in environmental monitoring particularly in border areas are vulnerable to various security threats caused by illegal intruders who perform eavesdropping, garnishing, gray-hole attacks, etc. to compromise the network and forge the sensitive data. A multi-level hierarchical secure and optimal routing (ML-HSOR) protocol is proposed to overcome these issues. The proposed ML-HSOR protocol has four stages: registration, clustering, authentication, and optimal routing. In the registration step, the new sensor nodes are registered with the base station (BS) using unique identities. In the clustering stage, a Markov model with adaptive weighting mechanism is used to choose the most suitable node as the cluster head (CH), enhancing network lifespan and performance. The authentication stage involves a multi-level trust evaluation to detect malicious nodes. The aggregated message and timestamp are encrypted, and finally, the optimal data transmission path is chosen based on the polarity learning-based chimp optimization algorithm (PL-COA). This approach computes node fitness based on residual energy, distance, link quality, delay, and trust, ensuring high packet delivery ratio (PDR) (99.8% for 500 nodes), high throughput (48,000 bits per second for 500 nodes), less delay (0.058s for 500 nodes), high detection rate (95%), and less energy consumption (0.39 J for 500 nodes).",none

Fuzzy logic based nodes distributed clustering for energy efficient fault tolerance in IoT-enabled WSN,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.3233/JIFS-221733,1,research-article,ACM,2023,"The Internet of Things (IoT) enabled wireless sensor network (WSN) is now widely employed in various sectors like smart city and vehicle transportation for their expanded capabilities such as data storage, access, and monitoring. The use of smart sensors that continuously collect data from the smart environment makes these possible. Furthermore, these facilitate the easy access of stored data over a secure IoT-gateway for mobile users. This device mobility that allows shifting to multiple locations, makes it challenging to route data across many access points.

Resource pooling in vehicular fog computing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1186/s13677-021-00233-x,4,research-article,ACM,2021,"Vehicular fog computing (VFC) provisions computing services at the edge of networks by fully exploiting the idle resources of vehicle loaded computer systems. Task scheduling and resource allocation revolved around VFC have gained tremendous attention recently. Currently, most of these works in VFC have focused on response time optimization or energy reduction. Computing services are provisioned in a pay-as-you-go model and vehicles as resource contributors are stimulated by the benefits obtained by leasing these resources. How to maximize their own benefits is one of big concerns but few of current works have recognized its importance in VFC.

Dynamic Sensor Scheduling for Data Size Reduction in a Sensor Cloud System Based on Minimum Reconstruction Error,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11277-024-11090-7,0,research-article,ACM,2024,"Sensing and subsequent analysis of the environmental data of a given geographical area is an essential requisite for the planned development of that region. Nowadays, IoT Sensor-Cloud ecosystem has been adopted to collect data from IoT sensors and transmit it to the chosen Cloud Server for further processing and dissemination. In a large Wireless Sensor Network formed by the IoT sensors, there will be a significant amount of redundancy in the dataset when the nodes are placed closely, and the sensed data varies slowly and gradually with regard to time and space. Then, avoiding redundant data transmission can lead to lower energy consumption and communication overhead. Adaptive subset selection of sensor nodes for data size reduction in a Wireless Sensor Network is an approach to efficiently managing the amount of data transmitted within the network. Then, in the current time schedule, it is possible to optimally select a subset of the sensor nodes for data collection without very much affecting the overall data fidelity. An optimal sensor node subset selection scheme that reduces the communication load with minimum information loss is proposed to achieve this task. The unselected nodes are put in sleep mode, which consequently results in lower sensor energy expenditure. The subset selection algorithm is implemented based on the derivative-free pattern search optimizer that minimizes the reconstruction error during the associated extrapolation. This approach differs entirely from the Compressive Data Gathering approach. The simulation results reveal that the performance of the proposed scheme is superior to other similar competitive methods in terms of the mean square error, which is found to be 1.95, with the percentage participation nodes equal to 50% and when the sensor data is uniformly distributed over 20 and 30 units.",none

Reliable data exchange between sensor nodes and efficient data transmission to the collecting station i.e. base station is a vital issue in WSN. Secured routing will play a key role to overcome these issues. The most important initiative behind this research is to convert the energy-aware routing protocol into reactive energy aware secure protocol of routing for detection of fail/malicious sensor nodes. Efficient clustering is the first step; here advanced Low-Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy (LEACH) is used for efficient cluster head (CH) selection based on initial energy, residual energy and distance to the base station. Further an optimized routing protocol based on grasshopper optimization algorithm (GOA) is used to make shortest path low energy consumption transmission.

A dual-hop topology-aware routing protocol for underwater optical wireless sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.osn.2022.100682,0,research-article,ACM,2022,"Underwater optical wireless communication (UOWC) is an emerging technology for underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs). Compared with acoustic waves and radio frequency waves, optical waves can provide higher data rates and lower latency. However, given the limited transmission range and energy supply, as well as the existence of communication void regions in UOWC which may further deteriorate its transmission performances (e.g. packet deliver rate), effective multi-hop routing schemes are highly desirable for UOWC to expand its transmission range with satisfactory performance. In this paper, we propose a dual-hop topology-aware (DHTA) routing algorithm for UOWC. By adopting dual-hop routing strategy, the proposed algorithm reduces the packet entry possibility into void regions, and thus improves the packet deliver rate. And by selecting the next relay node considering both the available distance of transmission and the deviation of transmission direction, the proposed algorithm can effectively reduce the average energy consumption of the network. Besides, a threshold is employed by the proposed algorithm for energy balance to prevent excessive energy consumption of some nodes. The simulation results verify that the proposed DHTA routing algorithm effectively alleviates the effluence of void regions on forwarding packet and increases the packet delivery rate (PDR), with reduced average energy consumption and energy standard deviation.",none
DAG block: Trust aware load balanced routing and lightweight authentication encryption in WSN,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.future.2022.10.011,0,review-article,ACM,2023,"A wireless sensor network (WSN) is a staple network architecture that can be widely used to support diverse of applications as smart cities, smart homes, etc. However, energy consumption and security was still a major concern. The blockchain is a potential solution for security provisioning in WSN. However, due to resource constraint nature of the WSN nodes the adoption of classic blockchain leads to high energy consumption, slow transaction processing and poor scalability. To overcome the above issues, we propose Directed Acyclic Graph-based Trust aware Load Balanced Routing (DAG-BTLBR). Initially, the sensor nodes are unequally clustered in an energy-efficient manner to reduce the hotspot problem using Emperor Penguin Colony (EPC) algorithm. After clustering, packets are transmitted through load-balanced routes in secure manner using Adaptive Neuro-based Dual Fuzzy (ANDual Fuzzy) system which reduces the energy consumption by selecting optimal secure routes.

These multi-objective fitness functions consider factors, like energy, delay, throughput, distance between the nodes and cluster density. After the cluster head selection, the optimal path is used to transfer the data to the base station. The optimal path is based on three parameters, such as degree of satisfication, connectivity and Rate of service (RoS).

An efficient energy-aware and reliable routing protocol to enhance the performance of wireless body area networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11227-024-06039-3,0,research-article,ACM,2024,"A wireless body area network (WBAN) is a type of wireless sensor network that plays a crucial role in monitoring patient healthcare. In this network, sensor nodes are typically placed inside or outside the patient’s body. These nodes are capable of transmitting data to the sink node when any functional changes in the patient are detected. The routing and energy efficiency of the network nodes are challenging tasks in WBAN, as each sensor node operates on a battery. Therefore, in multi-hop routing designing a robust routing protocol has a significant impact on reducing energy consumption during the selection of the next hop. In this paper, a simple novel routing protocol named simple energy-aware and reliable (SEAR) routing protocol is proposed to transmit reliable data packets in a WBAN. The proposed routing scheme considers the remaining energy of sensor nodes, priority data, and hop count to the sink node as significant metrics for dynamically selecting the best forwarder node. Furthermore, the proposed protocol utilizes the route reliability factor (RRF) to select the optimal route among all possible routes between the source sensor node and the sink node. RRF selects the route with the maximum route residual energy and minimum hop count. As a result, SEAR has the ability to provide effective single-hop and multi-hop routing data transmission to improve the reliability of data transmission, decrease the energy consumption of the sensor nodes, and prolong the lifetime of the network. The simulation results show that the performance of the SEAR routing protocol outperforms the existing routing protocols for the metrics: packet loss ratio, throughput, end-to-end delay, normalized routing load, energy consumption, and network lifetime. The results indicate that the proposed protocol improves total energy consumption by 18.76% and 10.89% when compared to EERR-RLFL and AMCRP respectively.

Furthermore, the collected data, in order to be treated, have to be transmitted to a base station in the area, near the sensors. In this work, the future monitoring missions of the network are also taken into account, as well as the energy consumption of the current mission. We also consider that the spatial trajectories of the targets are known, whereas the speed of the targets along their trajectories are estimated, and subject to uncertainty. Hence, the main objective is to seek solutions that can withstand earliness and tardiness from the previsions. We propose a formulation of the problem with three different objectives and a solution method with experiments and results.

Distributed Cooperative Reinforcement Learning for Wireless Sensor Network Routing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/WCNC51071.2022.9771591,0,research-article,ACM,2022,"In this work we examine a specific case of wireless sensor networks (WSN) we call peer-to-peer WSN where source and destination are both dynamic and each is subject to constraints of low bandwidth, limited energy storage, and limited computational resources. Peer-to-peer WSN require the consideration of data computation time as a limiting constraint on information availability unlike a standard WSN that can rely on the unconstrained sink to perform the necessary computation of the raw sensor data into usable information. To effectively manage and improve upon peer-to-peer WSN routing, and WSN routing in general, we present a deep reinforcement learning algorithm known as distributed cooperative reinforcement for routing (DCRL-R) which uses a neural network and expanded state space parameters to learn routing policies for WSN. DCRL-R also incorporates an increased action space for determining when and where to perform in-network computation of the raw sensor data. We perform tests of DCRL-R on a physical network utilizing measured node state parametric data and show its viability in future WSN applications compared to a baseline routing algorithm using shortest path decisions with no computational offloading.",none
Fuzzy clustering and optimal routing in wireless sensor network,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.3233/JIFS-221370,0,research-article,ACM,2023,"A wireless sensor network (WSN) is a collection of numerous independent sensor nodes that can sense, process, and manipulate data. WSN is grouped into clusters for energy-efficient data collection. A clustering and aggregation technique automatically extends the lifetime of a WSN by collecting data within the cluster to the cluster head, reduces the amount of data through processing, and transmitting. WSN routing protocols are also required for completing all types of operations in a Internet of things (IOT) environment, such as sensing, controlling, and transmitting packets. In this paper, a novel Fuzzy Clustering and Optimal Routing (FCOR) method is proposed in order to lessen the energy consumption, delay, and improve network lifetime and node density. The proposed FCOR method is executed in two stages. The initial stage consists of clustering and cluster head selection using modified Fuzzy c-means algorithm (MFCM). This algorithm will efficiently cluster the nodes and select the optimal cluster head. The second phase consists of optimal routing using a normalized whale optimization algorithm (NWOA), that select the optimal route and thus improve the lifetime of the nodes. The efficiency of the proposed FCOR approach has been determined using the evaluation metrics such as energy efficiency, packet delivery, and network lifetime. The experimental results reveals that the proposed FCOR model achieves less energy consumption of 67.8%, 54.4%, 60% and 6.67% than existing FRNSEER, E-ALWO, ACI-GSO and CRSH respectively.",none

Q-Learning Based Multi-Channel Aware Routing Protocol for Optical-Acoustic Hybrid Underwater Wireless Sensor Network,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3631726.3631754,0,short-paper,ACM,2024,"In recent years, underwater visible light communication has been used to facilitate optical-acoustic hybrid communications in underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs).

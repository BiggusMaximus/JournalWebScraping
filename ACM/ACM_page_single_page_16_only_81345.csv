Effects of vertex insertion on local rescheduling in wireless sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1504/IJAHUC.2018.089824,0,article,ACM,2018,"Rescheduling has abundant issues yet to be explored. The local rescheduling problem in wireless sensor networks WSNs have been firstly addressed and investigated in this paper. The algorithms of local rescheduling have been proposed and evaluates the performance of reschedule solutions with different metrics. The solutions have to be under the limitation that the network should stay connected after the process of rescheduling. This paper introduces a theoretical bound of maximum degree after node insertion. Along with empirical results in real world settings, the results motivate the design of algorithms and give possible reasons why existing rescheduling algorithms do not work efficiently. Two local link rescheduling algorithms and one local broadcast rescheduling algorithm are developed as improvements. With different node densities and other critical parameters, simulations show that the developed algorithms greatly improve the ratio of finding proper solutions successfully in both types of scheduling compared with other existing simple algorithms.",none
A grid-based cooperative QoS routing protocol with fading memory optimization for navigation carrier ad hoc networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.comnet.2014.11.017,1,research-article,ACM,2015,"Cooperative QoS routing (CQR) protocols have the potential to provide scalable information delivery in multi-service network application. However, CQR approach in harsh environments, in terms of long-range transmission, high dynamic topology, and three-dimensional monitor region, is still an open issue. In this paper, we propose a novel grid-based routing approach, namely FMCQR protocol, to guarantee QoS-aware routing for heterogeneous services in above harsh environments. Our approach is explored by the synthesis of three kernel features. First, a grid-based route model is developed on the basis of two key points, i.e., Three-dimensional Geographic Grid (TGG) space and Controlled Virtual Node (CVN). Hereinto, TGG provides a refined virtual addressing space; CVN, basically a distributed cooperative strategy within TGG border, forms the intra-TGG nodes into a virtual MIMO agent, thus the three-dimensional high dynamic topology can be transferred into a CVN-based stationary topology in TGG space. Second, a QoS routing mechanism, namely CQR, is introduced to guarantee QoS-aware route for heterogeneous requests with the assist from CVN-based metrics, and achieve the route discovery in unknown environments by switching between relay-destination (RD) and source-relay (SR) searching algorithms. Third, a novel Fading Memory Optimization (FMO) algorithm, based on Ebbinghaus memory principle, is designed to further enhance the route efficiency. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to assess the effectiveness of the above features, compared to related typical routing protocols, our approach has better convergence and better QoS in terms of successful delivery ratio, average delay, average link overhead, and normalized routing distance.",none

Threats of security attacks are growing on the Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs). MANETs must require a secure mode for communication and transmission which is rather challenging and vigorous issue. With the aim of providing secure transmission and communication, researcher worked explicitly on the security concerns in MANETs. Several secure protocols and security methods within the networks were projected but utmost of the security measures in their designs are not ruminated.

To overhear or not to overhear: a dilemma between network coding gain and energy consumption in multi-hop wireless networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11276-018-1733-0,0,research-article,ACM,2019,"Any properly designed network coding technique can result in increased throughput and reliability of multi-hop wireless networks by taking advantage of the broadcast nature of wireless medium. In many inter-flow network coding schemes nodes are encouraged to overhear neighbour’s traffic in order to improve coding opportunities at the transmitter nodes. A study of these schemes reveal that some of the overheard packets are not useful for coding operation and thus this forced overhearing increases energy consumption dramatically. In this paper, we formulate network coding aware sleep/wakeup scheduling as a semi Markov decision process (SMDP) that leads to an optimal node operation. In the proposed solution for SMDP, the network nodes learn when to switch off their transceiver in order to conserve energy and when to stay awake to overhear some useful packets.

Feasible HCCA Polling Mechanism for Video Transmission in IEEE 802.11e WLANs,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11277-015-2816-1,2,article,ACM,2015,"IEEE 802.11e standard defines two Medium Access Control functions to support Quality of Service (QoS) for wireless local area networks: Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) and HCF Controlled Channel Access (HCCA). EDCA provides fair prioritized QoS support while HCCA guarantees parameterized QoS for the traffics with rigid QoS requirements. The latter shows higher QoS provisioning with Constant Bit Rate traffics. However, it does not efficiently cope with the fluctuation of the Variable Bit Rate (VBR) video streams since its reference scheduler generates a schedule based on the mean characteristics of the traffic. Scheduling based on theses characteristics is not always accurate as these traffics show high irregularity over the time. In this paper, we propose an enhancement on the HCCA polling mechanism to address the problem of scheduling pre-recorded VBR video streams. Our approach enhances the polling mechanism by feed-backing the arrival time of the subsequent video frame of the uplink traffic obtained through cross-layering approach.

Toward Performant and Energy-Efficient Network Queries: A Parallel and Stateless Approach,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1155/2023/6185758,0,research-article,ACM,2023,"In many edge computing applications (e.g., wireless sensor networks, WSNs) where nodes are mostly battery-powered, queries’ energy consumption, and response time are two of the most important metrics, representing the network’s sustainability and performance, respectively.

At the same time, the hibernating mechanism is proposed to prolong the network life cycle. Moreover, a new algorithm is devised to allow the queries and results to be transmitted through low-power and fault-tolerant paths using recursive elections over a subset of the entire power range.

Countermeasures for Primary User Emulation Attack: A Comprehensive Review,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11277-020-07600-y,2,review-article,ACM,2020,"Cognitive radio (CR) is a flexible wireless network that can solve the scarcity and underutilization problem of the spectrum by permitting unlicensed users to access licensed bands. The dynamic nature of CR makes it more vulnerable in terms of security.

In this attack, a malicious user imitates the signal characteristics of a licensed user (primary user) to disguise its true identity.

Near Optimal Charging and Scheduling Scheme for Stochastic Event Capture with Rechargeable Sensors,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/MASS.2013.60,3,Article,ACM,2013,"Though much existing work exploits wireless power charging to enhance sensor network performance such as routing and data aggregation, few efforts focus on issues of stochastic event capture. In this paper, we consider the scenario in which a mobile charger (MC) periodically travels within a sensor network to recharge the sensors wirelessly, to maximize the Quality of Monitoring (QoM) for stochastic events. Towards this goal, two closely related research issues need to be addressed. One is how to choose the sensors for charging and decide the charging time for each of them, the other is how to best schedule the sensors' activation schedules according to their received energy. In this paper, we jointly design the charging scheme and sensor schedules to maximize the QoM. We formulate our problem formally as the maximum QoM charging and scheduling problem (MQCSP). Obtaining an exact solution of MQCSP is challenging. Thus we first ignore the MC's travel time and study the resulting relaxed version of MQCSP, R-MQCSP. We show both MQCSP and R-MQCSP are NP-hard. For R-MQCSP, however, under a special condition, we prove that it can be formulated as a sub modular function maximization problem. This formulation allows a 1/6-approximation algorithm for the general case, and a unified algorithm with a series of approximation factors (up to 1-1/e) for a special case. Then, for MQCSP, we propose approximation algorithms by extending our R-MQCSP results. Finally, we conduct extensive trace-driven simulations to validate our algorithm design. The empirical results corroborate our theoretical analysis.",none

The aim of this article is to reduce the energy consumption of the UAVs-empowered MFC system by designing UAVs’ trajectories. To construct the trajectories of UAVs, we need to consider not only the order of SPs but also the association among UAVs, SPs, and MIoTDs. The above-mentioned problem is very complicated and is difficult to be handled via applying traditional techniques, as it is NP-hard, nonlinear, non-convex, and mixed-integer. To handle this problem, we propose a novel simulated annealing trajectory optimization algorithm (SATOA), which handles the problem in three phases. First, the deployment (i.e., number and locations) of stop points (SPs) is updated and produced randomly using variable population sizes. Accordingly, MIoTDs are associated with SPs and extra SPs are removed. Finally, a novel simulated annealing algorithm is proposed to optimize UAVs’ association with SPs as well as their trajectories.

Several trust management models have been proposed in the IoT environment; however, these schemes have not fully addressed the IoT devices’ features, such as device’s role, device type and its dynamic behavior in a smart environment. As a result, traditional trust and reputation models are insufficient to tackle these characteristics and uncertainty risks while connecting nodes to the network.

Edge computing-oriented smart agricultural supply chain mechanism with auction and fuzzy neural networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1186/s13677-024-00626-8,0,research-article,ACM,2024,"Powered by data-driven technologies, precision agriculture offers immense productivity and sustainability benefits. However, fragmentation across farmlands necessitates distributed transparent automation. We developed an edge computing framework complemented by auction mechanisms and fuzzy optimizers that connect various supply chain stages. Specifically, edge computing offers powerful capabilities that enable real-time monitoring and data-driven decision-making in smart agriculture. We propose an edge computing framework tailored to agricultural needs to ensure sustainability through a renewable solar energy supply. Although the edge computing framework manages real-time crop monitoring and data collection, market-based mechanisms, such as auctions and fuzzy optimization models, support decision-making for smooth agricultural supply chain operations. We formulated invisible auction mechanisms that hide actual bid values and regulate information flows, combined with machine learning techniques for robust predictive analytics. While rule-based fuzzy systems encode domain expertise in agricultural decision-making, adaptable training algorithms help optimize model parameters from the data. A two-phase hybrid learning approach is formulated. Fuzzy optimization models were formulated using domain expertise for three key supply chain decision problems. Auction markets discover optimal crop demand–supply balancing and pricing signals. Fuzzy systems incorporate domain knowledge into interpretable crop-advisory models. An integrated evaluation of 50 farms over five crop cycles demonstrated the high performance of the proposed edge computing-oriented auction-based fuzzy neural network model compared with benchmarks.",none
Entropy-based active learning for wireless scheduling with incomplete channel feedback,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.comnet.2016.05.001,0,research-article,ACM,2016,"Most of the opportunistic scheduling algorithms in literature assume that full wireless channel state information (CSI) is available for the scheduler. However, in practice obtaining full CSI may introduce a significant overhead. In this paper, we present a learning-based scheduling algorithm which operates with partial CSI under general wireless channel conditions. The proposed algorithm predicts the instantaneous channel rates by employing a Bayesian approach and using Gaussian process regression. It quantifies the uncertainty in the predictions by adopting an entropy measure from information theory and integrates the uncertainty to the decision-making process. It is analytically proven that the proposed algorithm achieves an ź fraction of the full rate region that can be achieved only when full CSI is available. Numerical analysis conducted for a CDMA based cellular network operating with high data rate (HDR) protocol, demonstrate that the full rate region can be achieved our proposed algorithm by probing less than 50% of all user channels.",none

DL has gradually become the most widely used computational approach in the field of machine learning, achieving remarkable results in various complex cognitive tasks that are comparable to, or even surpassing human performance. One of the key benefits of DL is its ability to learn from vast amounts of data. In recent years, the DL field has witnessed rapid expansion and has found successful applications in various conventional areas. Significantly, DL has outperformed established ML techniques in multiple domains, such as cloud computing, robotics, cybersecurity, and several others. Nowadays, cloud computing has become crucial owing to the constant growth of the IoT network.

Dynamic adaptive workload offloading strategy in mobile edge computing networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.comnet.2023.109878,0,research-article,ACM,2023,"With the increasing popularity of mobile devices and explosive growth of task processing requirements, edge computing attracts more attention from researchers nowadays since it can improve the QoS and utilize resources of the cloudlets, including mobile devices and base stations, as much as possible. In a Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) network, the workload offloading problem is quite important since it directly influences the latency of the task processing, and many efficient algorithms have been proposed to deal with it. However, most of the existing algorithms only consider the static or quasi-static scenario, and are not suitable for a system with several fast-moving devices. Since that more and more mobile devices with high speed are involved in a MEC system, a new workload offloading strategy is required to adapt to such a dynamic scenario. In this paper, we sufficient consider the dynamic properties of a MEC system, and proposed a dynamic adaptive workload offloading algorithm based on Lyapunov theories and an FC-LSTM based schedule determining algorithm to balance the workload of different cloudlets and minimize the weighted average energy and time consumption of mobile devices. Theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results show that all the proposed algorithms achieve high performance in terms of energy consumption, convergence and latency.",none
Data Collection Method of Energy Adaptive Distributed Wireless Sensor Networks Based on UAV,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1155/2022/3469221,0,research-article,ACM,2022,"In sensor networks, UAVs are often introduced to assist data collection tasks. UAVs can operate as data ferry nodes, connecting distributed areas that are separated from each other. This paper proposes a data collection method for distributed wireless sensor networks based on UAV and introduces the idea of edge computing in it. In the single-hop transmission scenario, the K-means++ clustering method is used for sensor node clustering and cluster head election in the initial state. In the next rounds of data collection, UAV is used to assist in the election of new cluster heads and data collection tasks, taking into account the relative distance and the relative remaining energy relationship of the sensor nodes in their clusters. In addition, reasonable priorities are set for some nodes that have never been elected in the previous rounds and for the dead nodes. In the multihop transmission scenarios, for nodes that cannot deliver directly, the optimal relay node is selected for routing by comprehensively considering factors such as transmission angle, transmission distance, and remaining energy of the node in each cluster. The method proposed in this paper coordinates the overall energy consumption of sensor nodes in the environmental monitoring area, delays the death time of key sensor nodes, and extends the network lifetime. At the same time, an improved ACO is used to reasonably plan the data collection path of the UAV. Compared with the comparison scheme, the improved ACO can obtain a better shortest path length and has the fastest convergence speed when reaching the shortest path.",none
On the Global Maximization of Network Lifetime in Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3510423,3,research-article,ACM,2022,"In a Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Network (WRSN), a mobile charger (MC) moves and supplies energy for sensor nodes to maintain the network operation. Hence, optimizing the charging schedule of MC is essential to maximize the network lifetime in WRSNs. The existing works only target the local optimization of network lifetime limited to MC’s subsequent charging round. The network lifetime has been normally reflected in a different metric that is not directly related to the final charging round period. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to address the global maximization of network lifetime in WRSNs, which optimizes not only the subsequent charging round but all charging rounds over the entire network lifetime. Another uniqueness is the joint consideration of both the charging path and charging time optimization problems. As a solution, we propose a genetic algorithm (GA)-based global optimization scheme that considers all the possible charging rounds. The GA has a novel mutation operation that mutates gene sizes for representing charging schedules with a varying number of charging rounds. The experiment results show that our algorithm can extend the network lifetime by 35.1 times on average and 38.6 times in the best case compared to existing ones.",none
Routing protocols in underwater acoustic sensor networks: a quantitative comparison,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1155/2015/858593,2,article,ACM,2015,"Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks (UASNs) have drawn great attention for their potential value in ocean monitoring and offshore exploration. In order to make the underwater application possible, the unique characteristics of underwater acoustic channels and continuous node movement inspired the emergence of routing protocols for underwater environment. In this paper, we introduce and compare four prominent routing protocols proposed for UASNs, namely, H2-DAB, GEDAR, E-PULRP, and PER. Performances of the routing protocols are evaluated in terms of the average number of control packets, end-to-end delay, data delivery ratio, and total energy consumption. The impact of water currents on the routing algorithms is also analyzed in our simulation. Experimental results demonstrate that E-PULRP provides high data delivery ratio at the cost of end-to-end delay. H2- DAB has better real-time performance for minimal delay transmission. GEDAR efficiently addresses the problem of void region without introducing extra energy. PER requires the most control packets in the process of routing establishment.

Numerous contributions have been made to address the aforementioned issues of WBAN and are classified as temperature-aware routing protocols, cluster-based routing protocols, QoS-aware routing protocols and postural movement based routing protocols. This paper qualitatively analyzes the performance of the variously proposed protocols in terms of energy efficiency, provision of QoS, mobility, end-to-end delay, and temperature-rise.

An Energy Aware Approach to Trust Management Systems for Embedded Multi-Agent Systems,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/978-3-030-30856-8_9,0,Article,ACM,2019,"With the growing interest toward pervasive systems such as the Internet of Things or Cyber-Physical Systems, embedded multi-agent systems have been increasingly investigated. In these systems, agents cooperate to achieve their local goals and a global goal that would be impossible for an isolated agent to achieve. However, the dark side of this collaboration is that agents can easily be victim of malicious attacks coming from untrustworthy agents. Consequently, trust management systems are designed to help agents choosing trustworthy counterparts to cooperate based on available information. But gathering the necessary information may be too expensive in terms of energy for small embedded agents and not relevant in all contexts. We propose a solution that allows agents to manage the energy consumption associated with information gathering. Our solution uses a Multi-Armed Bandit algorithm, which is a reinforcement learning technique to allow the agents to adapt themselves and their energy consumption to the context.",none
Scheduling and power control for energy-optimality of low duty cycled sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1155/2015/432978,1,article,ACM,2015,"The main limitation of operating sensor networks autonomously is the finite battery capacity of sensor nodes. Sensors are usually operated at low duty cycle; that is, they remain in active mode for short duration of time, in order to prolong the network lifetime. However, operating at low duty cycle may result in significant performance degradation in system operation. Hence, in this work, we quantitatively investigate the tradeoff between the duty cyle and network performance. Specifically, we address the design of efficient channel access protocol, by developing a scheduling algorithm based on well known Lyapunov optimization framework. Our proposed policy dynamically schedules transmissions of sensor nodes and their sleep cycles by taking into account the time-varying channel state information, traffic arrivals, and energy consumptions due to switching between operational modes. We analytically show that our policy is energy optimal in the sense that it achieves an energy consumption which is arbitrarily close to the global minimum solution.

Deep optimization algorithm for emergency-aware data transmission in Mobile-Ad Hoc Networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.3233/JIFS-233425,0,research-article,ACM,2023,"Mobile Adhoc Network (MANET) is a dynamic network with mobility nodes.

Multi-objective ant colony optimisation-based routing in WSNs,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1504/IJBIC.2014.065595,3,article,ACM,2014,"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are expected to play an important role for sensing applications in the near future.

A realistic relay selection scheme for cooperative MIMO networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.adhoc.2021.102706,1,research-article,ACM,2022,"Most IoT devices are battery powered and have limited power supplies.

Different relay selection approaches have been proposed in the past. They assume that the battery discharge is linear, but the effectiveness of these schemes is not guaranteed when realistic non-linear battery models are considered. We propose a relay selection scheme by considering a realistic battery discharge model. We present an analytical study which demonstrates that, using cooperative relays nodes, offers a longer lifetime than using only one relay for each transmission round.

Evolutionary multi-path routing for network lifetime and robustness in wireless sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.adhoc.2016.08.005,10,research-article,ACM,2016,"Wireless sensor networks frequently use multi-path routing schemes between nodes and a base station. Multi-path routing confers additional robustness against link failure, but in battery-powered networks it is desirable to choose paths which maximise the overall network lifetime - the time at which a battery is first exhausted. We introduce multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to find the routings which approximate the optimal trade-off between network lifetime and robustness. A novel measure of network robustness, the fragility, is introduced. We show that the distribution of traffic between paths in a given multi-path scheme that optimises lifetime or fragility may be found by solving the appropriate linear program. A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is used to solve the combinatorial optimisation problem of choosing routings and traffic distributions that give the optimal trade-off between network lifetime and robustness. Efficiency is achieved by pruning the search space using k-shortest paths, braided and edge disjoint paths. The method is demonstrated on synthetic networks and a real network deployed at the Victoria & Albert Museum, London. For these networks, using only two paths per node, we locate routings with lifetimes within 3% of those obtained with unlimited paths per node. In addition, routings which halve the network fragility are located. We also show that the evolutionary multi-path routing can achieve significant improvement in performance over a braided multi-path scheme.",none
pTunes: runtime parameter adaptation for low-power MAC protocols,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2185677.2185730,94,research-article,ACM,2012,"We present pTunes, a framework for runtime adaptation of low-power MAC protocol parameters. The MAC operating parameters bear great influence on the system performance, yet their optimal choice is a function of the current network state. Based on application requirements expressed as network lifetime, end-to-end latency, and end-to-end reliability, pTunes automatically determines optimized parameter values to adapt to link, topology, and traffic dynamics. To this end, we introduce a flexible modeling approach, separating protocol-dependent from protocol-independent aspects, which facilitates using pTunes with different MAC protocols, and design an efficient system support that integrates smoothly with the application. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we apply pTunes to X-MAC and LPP. In a 44-node testbed, pTunes achieves up to three-fold lifetime gains over static MAC parameters optimized for peak traffic, the latter being current - and almost unavoidable - practice in real deployments. pTunes promptly reacts to changes in traffic load and link quality, reducing packet loss by 80% during periods of controlled wireless interference.

A cyclic MAC scheduler for collecting data from heterogeneous sensors,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.comcom.2011.02.012,1,article,ACM,2011,"Many wireless sensor networks applications, e.g., structural health monitoring (SHM), require the sensors to construct a multihop network to collect the environmental data in real-time. These sensors generally generate sensing data in fixed rates, so their transmission schedules can be deterministically listed. Time division multiple access (TDMA) is especially appropriate for these applications because it can prevent radio interference, thereby reducing the transmission power and maximizing wireless spectrum reuse. However, to reserve sufficient bandwidths on distinct links of a heterogeneous WSN, a complex TDMA schedule is necessary, and a sensor node might need to keep a large TDMA schedule table in its tiny memory. To prevent a large size TDMA schedule table, this paper proposes a CyclicMAC scheduler that assigns each node a temporal transmission pattern which is merely parameterized by period and phase. The CyclicMAC scheduler determines the period to satisfy the bandwidth requirement of the node, and adjusts the phase to achieve collision-freeness and reduce the end-to-end latency as well. The end-to-end latency of the resulting schedule is proven to be optimal if the wireless links only interfere with their parent link and sibling links. As far as we know, CyclicMAC is the first that simultaneously addresses the three design issues of TDMA scheduling, which satisfies heterogeneous bandwidth requirements, minimizing schedule table size, and reducing end-to-end latency, for multihop wireless sensor networks.",none

This paper addresses this bottleneck by combining task scheduling and memory accesses so that the system architecture and memory modules of a multi-core DSP can be utilized as efficiently as possible. To improve the system and memory utilization, the key is to take advantage of locality as much as possible and integrate it into task scheduling. Two algorithms are proposed to optimize memory accesses while scheduling tasks with timing and resource constraints. The first one uses Integer Linear Programming (ILP) to produce a schedule with the most efficient memory access sequence while satisfying the constraints.

The standard cloud computing model is not capable of efficiently hosting IoT tasks due to the high latency associated with it. Hence, this work utilizes the mobile edge computing and fog concept to process the input tasks independent of the cloud layer. Generally, the high computation costs and energy consumption resulted in the applications such as power-hungry and computation-intensive, which become massive challenges for an IoT device. Motivated by the previous research, we mainly plan to investigate the resource allocation issues that arise in the MEC-enabled IoT–Fog–cloud architecture.

Traditional data aggregation methods often entail risks of sensitive information exposure during data transmission and storage. This paper proposes a novel Graphical Federated Learning-based Local Fennec Fox (GFL-LFF) algorithm to ensure secure aggregation by minimizing the revelation of individual data. In this study, a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with federated learning is employed to enhance privacy protection for IIoT's data aggregation scheme. A Local search-based fennec fox optimization is utilized for tuning the parameters of GNN.

Trajectory Matters: Impact of Jamming Attacks Over the Drone Path Planning on the Internet of Drones,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.adhoc.2023.103179,0,research-article,ACM,2023,"The Internet of Drones (IoD) is a network paradigm where drones will fly over well-defined airways. The Jamming Attack (JA) poses a severe risk to IoD, affecting the drone’s trajectory. Although JA has been investigated in UAV-based networks, the current solutions consider the airspace free to fly, whereas IoD allows drones to fly over constrained airspace, named airways. This study investigates the impact of JA over IoD, mainly regarding the drone path planning and, therefore, the drone trajectory. Also, we conduct a thorough discussion regarding the current challenges. To overcome these challenges, we propose the IoD-JAPM, an airway-aware protection mechanism against JA on the IoD, ranging from analyzing the airway’s availability to the potential reformulation of the drone path planning. We perform an experimental evaluation through simulations to compare IoD-JAPM with a baseline solution and an existing approach that considers the airspace free to fly, varying the IoD topology and the number of jammers in the environment. We analyze four different metrics to measure at what level IoD-JAPM can mitigate a JA. Through the results, we observe a relation between the impact of JA on the drone path planning and the robustness of the topology, where the more restricted the topology, the more impact JA causes. Also, IoD-JAPM mitigates the effects of JA on path planning, causing few reformulations or even flight cancellations. Specifically, IoD-JAPM prevents all drones from being attacked when the environment has one jammer and mitigates the attack at 30% for two jammers. Furthermore, IoD-JAPM overcomes the baseline study regarding the increasing drone flight distance, and power consumption. Since the drone propellers affect most of the drone battery, the more the flight distance the more the power consumption. Also, the results reinforce that “free-to-fly” approaches cannot be applied in airway-oriented environments with strong jamming signals. In a nutshell, IoD-JAPM represents a robust protection mechanism against JA considering the aerial space defined through airways, advancing the state of the art of IoD-based protection mechanisms against JA.",none
Perfectly Periodic Scheduling of Collective Data Streams,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TNET.2016.2629092,0,research-article,ACM,2017,"This paper addresses the problem of scheduling a single resource to handle requests for time-sensitive periodic services i.e., data streams jointly realizing a distributed application. We specifically consider the case, where the demand of each data stream is expressed as a weight relative to a network-wide cyclic schedule. Within this context, we consider the problem of minimizing the schedule length while satisfying the perfect periodicity constraints: the service intervals for the same data stream are fixed and each data stream is cyclically served exactly as many times as its demand. This problem is challenging, as serving a data stream in one time slot might enforce serving it at some specific time slots in the future. As a result, most of the existing solutions have relaxed either the periodicity or the demand constraints of the data streams. In contrast, we study the strict enforcement of both requirements through perfectly periodic schedules. We show that the considered problem is NP-hard and address special cases for which optimal schedules can be derived. We further discuss the more generic instance of the problem represented by an arbitrary number of data streams and demands. Specifically, we provide an approximation algorithm and an efficient greedy solution for such a general case of arbitrary weights. We conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed solutions. Finally, we show that it is possible to relax the input demands to improve the communication performance at the cost of some other overhead e.g., in terms of energy consumption.",none

Latency-minimizing data aggregation in wireless sensor networks under physical interference model,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.adhoc.2011.12.004,13,article,ACM,2014,"Minimizing latency is of primary importance for data aggregation which is an essential application in wireless sensor networks. Many fast data aggregation algorithms under the protocol interference model have been proposed, but the model falls short of being an accurate abstraction of wireless interferences in reality. In contrast, the physical interference model has been shown to be more realistic and has the potential to increase the network capacity when adopted in a design. It is a challenge to derive a distributed solution to latency-minimizing data aggregation under the physical interference model because of the simple fact that global-scale information to compute the cumulative interference is needed at any node. In this paper, we propose a distributed algorithm that aims to minimize aggregation latency under the physical interference model in wireless sensor networks of arbitrary topologies. The algorithm uses O(K) time slots to complete the aggregation task, where K is the logarithm of the ratio between the lengths of the longest and shortest links in the network. The key idea of our distributed algorithm is to partition the network into cells according to the value K, thus obviating the need for global information. We also give a centralized algorithm which can serve as a benchmark for comparison purposes. It constructs the aggregation tree following the nearest-neighbor criterion. The centralized algorithm takes O( logn) and O(log^3n) time slots when coupled with two existing link scheduling strategies, respectively (where n is the total number of nodes), which represents the current best algorithm for the problem in the literature.

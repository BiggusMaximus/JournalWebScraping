Internet of things multi hop energy efficient cluster-based routing using particle swarm optimization,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11276-021-02801-0,0,research-article,ACM,2021,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is a collection of various sensors connected to the internet that share information. In a large-scale IoT network, data is collected through the wireless sensor network (WSN), and the aggregated data is sent from the sink to the next level of IoT for processing. Clustering is utilized to cut down on energy use, network redundancy, interference, and collision in WSN and improve network lifetime, scalability, and data aggregation. In addition, multi-hop communication is more effective for networks with sensors that cover a broad region. The Multi-Hop Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy brings about a reduction to the transmission distance and prolongs the network lifetime. This particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique is effective for determining the most effective solutions for a particular problem. The particles in the PSO embody the candidate solutions tend to move through their solutions space (in several directions) in different velocities. A distributed multi-hop cluster-based routing algorithm that takes advantage of the PSO and the Lightening Search Algorithm is developed in this work. The proposed method optimizes the clustering process and achieves energy efficiency, as demonstrated by the experimental results. Reduced end-to-end delay and lower packet loss rate whereas the lifespan network and cluster count are improved.",none
BANSIM: A new discrete-event simulator for wireless body area networks with deep reinforcement learning in Python,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.sysarc.2022.102489,1,research-article,ACM,2022,"Many studies have investigated machine learning algorithms to improve the performance of wireless body area networks (WBANs). However, it was difficult to evaluate algorithms in a network simulator because of missing interfaces between the simulators and machine learning libraries. To solve the problem of compatibility, some researchers have attempted to interconnect existing network simulators and artificial intelligence (AI) frameworks. For example, ns3-gym is a simple interface between ns-3 (in C++) and the AI model (in Python) based on message queues and sockets. However, the most essential part is the implementation of an integrated event scheduler, which is left to the user. In this study, we aim to develop a new integrated event scheduler. We present BANSIM, a discrete-event network simulator for WBAN in standard Python that supports deep reinforcement learning (DRL). BANSIM provides an intuitive and simple DRL development environment with basic packet communication and BAN-specific components, such as the human mobility model and on-body channel model. Using BANSIM, users can easily build a WBAN environment, design a DRL-based protocol, and evaluate its performance. We experimentally demonstrated that BANSIM captured a wide range of interactions that occurred in the network. Finally, we verified the completeness and applicability of BANSIM by comparing it with an existing network simulator.",none
Energy-aware task scheduling by a true online reinforcement learning in wireless sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1504/IJSNET.2017.087899,2,article,ACM,2017,"Wireless sensor networks WSNs are an attractive platform for various pervasive computing applications.

Determining node duty cycle using Q-learning and linear regression for WSN,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11704-020-9153-6,5,research-article,ACM,2021,"Wireless sensor network (WSN) is effective for monitoring the target environment, which consists of a large number of sensor nodes of limited energy. An efficient medium access control (MAC) protocol is thus imperative to maximize the energy efficiency and performance of WSN. The most existing MAC protocols are based on the scheduling of sleep and active period of the nodes, and do not consider the relationship between the load condition and performance. In this paper a novel scheme is proposed to properly determine the duty cycle of the WSN nodes according to the load, which employs the Q-learning technique and function approximation with linear regression. This allows low-latency energy-efficient scheduling for a wide range of traffic conditions, and effectively overcomes the limitation of Q-learning with the problem of continuous state-action space. NS3 simulation reveals that the proposed scheme significantly improves the throughput, latency, and energy efficiency compared to the existing fully active scheme and S-MAC.",none
Exact and Approximation Algorithms for Data Mule Scheduling in a Sensor Network,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/978-3-319-28472-9_5,0,Article,ACM,2015,"We consider the fundamental problem of scheduling data mules for managing a wireless sensor network. A data mule tours around a sensor network and can help with network maintenance such as data collection and battery recharging/replacement. We assume that each sensor has a fixed data generation rate and a capacity upper bound on storage size. If the data mule arrives after the storage capacity is met, additional data generated is lost. In this paper we formulate several fundamental problems for the best schedule of single or multiple data mules and provide algorithms with provable performance. First, we consider using a single data mule to collect data from sensors, and we aim to maximize the data collection rate. We then generalize this model to consider k data mules. Additionally, we study the problem of minimizing the number of data mules such that it is possible for them to collect all data, without loss. For the above problems, when we assume that the capacities of all sensors are the same, we provide exact algorithms for special cases and constant-factor approximation algorithms for more general cases. We also show that several of these problems are NP-hard. When we allow sensor capacities to differ, we have a constant-factor approximation for each of the aforementioned problems when the ratio of the maximum capacity to the minimum capacity is constant.",none

An Energy-Aware Hybrid Approach for Wireless Sensor Networks Using Re-clustering-Based Multi-hop Routing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11277-021-08614-w,9,research-article,ACM,2021,"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) consist of a large number of sensor nodes, which are primarily employed for collecting data from an environment of interest. Energy resources of WSN nodes are generally restricted, irreplaceable and non-rechargeable. Hence, lowering the level of energy consumption in such networks to save more energy is the key issue in the literature. Clustering, selecting the best Cluster Head (CH) among candidates, and performing the routing only among cluster heads would be an effective approach to reduce the WSN nodes energy consumption. Therefore, cluster-based routing leads to extending the network’s lifetime through aggregating data in CHs, uniformly distributing the energy among nodes, and, consequently, reducing the number of contributing nodes in the routing procedure. In this paper, an energy-aware cluster-based multi-hop routing algorithm is presented, in which the clusters would, if required, re-formed during the routing procedure. Furthermore, like other multi-hop routing algorithms, it guarantees minimizing the energy consumption through balancing energy within the network. In this paper, we have presented a cluster-based multi-hop routing algorithm. In our proposed approach, a combination of two algorithms, namely K-means and Open Source Development Model Algorithm (ODMA), are employed for clustering, and Genetic Algorithm, is applied for multi-hop routing.

An adaptive load-aware routing algorithm for multi-interface wireless mesh networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11276-014-0804-0,5,article,ACM,2015,"In wireless mesh networks, the number of gateway nodes are limited, when the nodes access to the internet by fixed gateway node, different requirements of nodes lead to the dataflow shows heterogeneity.

"Reinforcement Learning for Multiple Access Control in Wireless Sensor Networks: Review, Model, and Open Issues",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11277-013-1028-9,0,article,ACM,2013,"Wireless sensor networking is a viable communication technology among low-cost and energy-limited sensor nodes deployed in an environment.

Decentralised reinforcement learning for energy-efficient scheduling in wireless sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1504/IJCNDS.2012.048871,9,article,ACM,2012,"We present a self-organising reinforcement learning (RL) approach for scheduling the wake-up cycles of nodes in a wireless sensor network. The approach is fully decentralised, and allows sensor nodes to schedule their active periods based only on their interactions with neighbouring nodes. Compared to standard scheduling mechanisms such as SMAC, the benefits of the proposed approach are twofold. First, the nodes do not need to synchronise explicitly, since synchronisation is achieved by the successful exchange of data messages in the data collection process. Second, the learning process allows nodes competing for the radio channel to desynchronise in such a way that radio interferences and therefore packet collisions are significantly reduced. This results in shorter communication schedules, allowing to not only reduce energy consumption by reducing the wake-up cycles of sensor nodes, but also to decrease the data retrieval latency. We implement this RL approach in the OMNET&#43;&#43; sensor network simulator, and illustrate how sensor nodes arranged in line, mesh and grid topologies autonomously uncover schedules that favour the successful delivery of messages along a routing tree while avoiding interferences.",none
A reinforcement learning-based link quality estimation strategy for RPL and its impact on topology management,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.comcom.2017.08.005,14,research-article,ACM,2017,"Over the last few years, standardisation efforts are consolidating the role of the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) as the standard routing protocol for IPv6-based Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Although many core functionalities are well defined, others are left implementation dependent. Among them, the definition of an efficient link-quality estimation (LQE) strategy is of paramount importance, as it influences significantly both the quality of the selected network routes and nodes energy consumption. In this paper, we present RL-Probe, a novel strategy for link quality monitoring in RPL, which accurately measures link quality with minimal overhead and energy waste. To achieve this goal, RL-Probe leverages both synchronous and asynchronous monitoring schemes to maintain up-to-date information on link quality and to promptly react to sudden topology changes, e.g. due to mobility. Our solution relies on a reinforcement learning model to drive the monitoring procedures in order to minimise the overhead caused by active probing operations. The performance of the proposed solution is assessed by means of simulations and real experiments. Results demonstrated that RL-Probe helps in effectively improving packet loss rates, allowing nodes to promptly react to link quality variations as well as to link failures due to node mobility.",none
Coping with Network Dynamics Using Reinforcement Learning Based Network Optimization in Wireless Sensor Networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11277-014-1684-4,0,article,ACM,2014,"Due to the constant increase of in density of wireless network devices, inter-network cooperation is increasingly important. To avoid conflicts, advanced algorithms for inter-network optimization utilize cognition processes such as reinforcement learning to enable networks to become capable of solving complex optimization problems on their own with minimal outside intervention. This paper investigates the inherent trade-offs that occur when using reinforcement learning techniques in dynamic networks: the need to keep the network running optimally whilst, at the same time, different (suboptimal) network settings need to be continuously investigated to cope with changing network conditions. To cope with these network dynamics, two existing algorithms, ""epsilon greedy"" and Softmax, are compared to a novel approach, based on a logarithmic probability distribution function. It is shown that, depending on the expected level of dynamics, the new algorithm outperforms existing solutions.",none

IRCTGP: A Novel Intra-node Resource Control Protocol Based on Traffic Priority and Evolutionary Games Theory for Wireless Sensor Networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11277-020-08046-y,1,research-article,ACM,2021,"A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is a network which is made up of resource-constrained wireless sensors with restricted capabilities. Quality of Service in Wireless Sensor Networks is still an open area of research, due to the fact that several problems need to be solved using resource constrained WSN nodes. The probability of congestion occurrence and packet loss in Wireless Sensor Networks is high, which makes it difficult to satisfy different qualities of service requirements. Congestion in WSN needs to be controlled to improve the quality of service such as throughput and packet loss ratio along with the packet delay. In particular, we proposed the use of evolutionary game theory in the design of a QoS-aware Intra-node congestion control protocol. Intra-node congestion control protocol is a non-cooperative asymmetric game that adjusts the queue accepting rate and queue service rate such that higher priority classes have lower loss rate and lower queuing delay.

EELRP: energy efficient layered routing protocol in wireless sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s00607-021-00996-w,10,research-article,ACM,2021,"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) consist of sensor nodes, which can sense, process, and then transfer different types of data into the base station. The major role of sensor nodes is to gather data at regular intervals and then send it into the base station. Designing energy-efficient routing protocols is one of the major challenges in WSNs. In this paper, an energy efficient layered routing protocol (EELRP) is proposed. The proposed method divides the network into some concentric circles of different radii. The circles are divided into eight equal sectors. Sections are created through a crossover between layers and sectors. Each section contains some nodes, and the most appropriate one is selected as the agent. The nodes of each section send the sensed data to their agent. Next, the agent aggregates the data, provides error detection and correction according to the redundant residue number system, and then sends information to the agent of the lower section of the same sector. The procedure continues until the information reaches the base station.

Outlier detection in WSN with SVDD via multi-interpolation auto-encoder,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1504/ijics.2023.133368,0,research-article,ACM,2023,"Due to limited resources and harsh deployment environments, data outliers frequently rise in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Hence, the collected data observations contain poor data quality and reliability. In recent years, research attempts have focused on utilising temporal and spatial correlation of the sensed data in WSNs but ignored the dependencies among the sensor node's attributes, which reduce overall communication. Instead of transmitting every sensed data of a corresponding sensor node to the base station, this paper pursues a novel approach to incorporating a representation method using an auto-encoder to identify the redundant data in its transmission path through cluster head (CH). With this scenario, this paper also empirically assesses the integration of auto-encoders and SVDD to learn a condensed form of a low dimensional data point by interpolating the convex combination of the sensed data, which can semantically mix their characteristics in a distributed manner and identify the outlier respectively.",none
Auto-localization algorithm for mobile sensor nodes in wireless sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11227-024-05920-5,0,research-article,ACM,2024,"In wireless sensor networks, location information is crucial to effectively use the event information recorded by the sensors. However, localizing mobile sensor nodes in resource-constrained networks presents several challenges, including determining the optimal number of anchor nodes, handling mobility, designing a path loss model, considering network topology, and addressing scalability and the number of localized nodes. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a coordinate-based auto-localization algorithm (CALA) with a single anchor node for mobile sensor nodes. The proposed algorithm uses an analytical model to determine the location of the target node by considering a parallel coordinate system and retrieving the original location of the target node by moving it to two different locations. The algorithm uses received signal strength indicator (RSSI) values for distance calculation while considering Rayleigh fading in the path loss model. The proposed algorithm’s performance is evaluated using various parameter settings, including mobility, node density, fading, path loss exponent, and different random seed values. The study finds that fading and path loss significantly influence the localization process, leading to an accuracy range of 10 to 30% when measuring distances using RSSI. The proposed method shows a 30% improvement in localization accuracy when the number of nodes increases from 5 to 20, achieving an average localization accuracy of 90% in a network with 20 sensor nodes. Furthermore, the study offers an in-depth investigation of the effect of various random generating situations on localization accuracy.

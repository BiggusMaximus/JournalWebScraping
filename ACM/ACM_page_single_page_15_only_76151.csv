QSec-RPL: Detection of version number attacks in RPL based mobile IoT using Q-Learning,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.adhoc.2023.103118,2,research-article,ACM,2023,"Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized the networking by connecting the real world entities to the Internet. IoT connects the communication devices and has an incredible impact on perspective analytics on the massive volume of data produced every day. An attacker may exploit vulnerabilities of IoT entities and compromise users’ security and privacy. Development of solutions to address security and privacy issues of IoT is in premature stage and considered as challenge. This challenge becomes more critical when the devices in the network are resource-constrained in terms of energy, processing and memory. The IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) has emerged in recent years as an adaptation layer to carry IPv6 packets over IEEE 802 . 15 . 4. Many IoT applications use Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) as a network layer protocol developed for routing in 6LoWPAN. Security is challenging in resource constrained environment where encryption may not be a viable solution. Version number attack is one of the most common network layer attacks against RPL based 6LoWPAN. The RPL specification does not address the integrity of the version number and therefore leaves version number mechanism as a weak point in terms of security. This paper investigates the impact of version number attack in RPL networks while considering mobility of the sensor nodes. We propose a solution that utilizes Q-Learning strategy to detect the malicious nodes that are performing version number attack. The proposed approach detects malicious nodes with reasonable accuracy while imposing significantly less overhead on the nodes of low power and lossy networks. There are other approaches too like Message Authentication Codes (MAC) based on symmetric keys but these techniques have memory and communication overhead. So we propose different approach Q-Learning to detect the attacker nodes.Highlights•Attacks in RPL based IoT.

A survey of energy efficient methods for UAV communication,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.vehcom.2023.100594,4,review-article,ACM,2023,"Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are characterized by high flexibility and low deployment costs. Therefore, UAVs, in recent years, have been widely used in all walks of life, such as logistics services, search and rescue, agriculture and mining. These applications are highly dependent on UAV communication technology. However, the UAVs currently in use are still powered by low-power batteries, which greatly limits the operational life of UAVs, resulting in varying degrees of communication interruptions and cost increases. Therefore, improving the energy efficiency (EE) of UAV communication has become a key problem that needs to be urgently solved. This article gives a comprehensive review of methods to improve the EE of UAVs through UAV trajectory planning and deployment, resource allocation and management, energy saving communication protocol design and UAV energy harvesting (EH) and transfer.

A congestion control framework for delay- and disruption tolerant networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.adhoc.2019.101880,1,research-article,ACM,2019,"Delay and Disruption Tolerant Networks (DTNs) are networks that experience frequent and long-lived connectivity disruptions. Unlike traditional networks, such as TCP/IP Internet, DTNs are often subject to high latency caused by very long propagation delays (e.g., interplanetary communication) and/or intermittent connectivity. In DTNs there is no guarantee of end-to-end connectivity between source and destination. Such distinct features pose a number of technical challenges in designing core network functions such as routing and congestion control mechanisms. Detecting and dealing with congestion in DTNs is an important problem since congestion can significantly deteriorate DTN performance. Most existing DTN congestion control mechanisms have been designed for a specific DTN application domain and have been shown to exhibit inadequate performance when used in different DTN scenarios and conditions.In this paper, we introduce Smart-DTN-CC, a novel DTN congestion control framework that adjusts its operation automatically based on the dynamics of the underlying network and its nodes. Smart-DTN-CC is an adaptive and distributed congestion aware framework that mitigates congestion using reinforcement learning, a machine learning technique known to be well suited to problems where: (1) the environment, in this case the network, plays a crucial role; and (2) yet, no prior knowledge about the target environment can be assumed, i.e., the only way to acquire information about the environment is to interact with it through continuous online learning.Smart-DTN-CC nodes receive input from the environment (e.g., buffer occupancy, neighborhood membership, etc), and, based on that information, choose an action to take from a set of possible actions. Depending on the selected action’s effectiveness in controlling congestion, a reward will be given. Smart-DTN-CC’s goal is to maximize the overall reward which translates to minimizing congestion. To our knowledge, Smart-DTN-CC is the first DTN congestion control framework that has the ability to automatically and continuously adapt to the dynamics of the target environment. As demonstrated by our experimental evaluation, Smart-DTN-CC is able to consistently outperform existing DTN congestion control mechanisms under a wide range of network conditions and characteristics.",none
An effective approach for reducing data redundancy in multi-agent system communication,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.3233/MGS-230089,0,research-article,ACM,2024,"The redundancy of the data is an active research topic. While an agent works in a multi-agent system, the number of messages between them increases. This is due to the fact that the functionalities data depends on other agents in terms of functional requirements. Typically, only one agent in a multi-agent system is responsible for accessing a database instead of replicating the database on each agent. A database is stored on multiple agents rather than a single agent to avoid a single point of failure. In this approach, the system has a higher load because one agent is responsible for all agent queries and must send duplicate messages to multiple agents, resulting in redundant data. In this research, we present Multi-Agent System for Commodity Data (MASCD) framework, the multi-agent system based communication using the distributed hash system, to reduce data redundancy in multi-agent system communication. Our anticipated method demonstrated how we divided the database names and efficiently distributed data to each agent. The database splitting is based on manufacturer names or product names. We utilize a table based on prime numbers. Through the hash function, we ascertain the index of the agent granted access to the relevant data. Each agent is accountable for its data. We use a Distributed Hash Table for efficient querying that stores data as key-value pairs. Each agent maintains a Finger Table containing the next and previous nodes for agent communication purposes. Using FIPA messages, we demonstrated how an agent could interact optimally. In conclusion, we illustrate the application of the proposed approach through a case study of mobile phones and university information systems.",none
Inspecting VANET with Various Critical Aspects – A Systematic Review,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.adhoc.2023.103281,2,article,ACM,2023,"Due to its strategic significance in the area of smart transportation to facilitate Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication, Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) have grown very popular in recent years. The rapid increase in the number of vehicles on the road has also led to the development of heterogeneous, large-scale, and highly dynamic VANETs, which introduce difficulty to fulfill the stringent requirements, which include low latency, high mobility, top security, and massive connectivity of the 5G network. Research works in VANETs mainly focus on message transmission within strict delay requirements based on different applications, data privacy and security.

Multi-objective routing optimisation for battery-powered wireless sensor mesh networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2576768.2598311,6,research-article,ACM,2014,"Mesh network topologies are becoming increasingly popular in battery powered wireless sensor networks, primarily due to the extension of network range and resilience against routing failures. However, multi-hop mesh networks suffer from higher energy costs, and the routing strategy directly affects the lifetime of nodes with limited energy sources. Hence while planning routes there are trade-offs to be considered between individual and system-wide battery lifetimes. We present a novel multi-objective routing optimisation approach using evolutionary algorithms to approximate the optimal trade-off between minimum lifetime and the average lifetime of nodes in the network. In order to accomplish this combinatorial optimisation rapidly and thus permit dynamic optimisation for self-healing networks, our approach uses novel $k$-shortest paths based search space pruning in conjunction with a new edge metric, which associates the energy cost at a pair of nodes with the link between them. We demonstrate our solution on a real network, deployed in the Victoria \& Albert Museum, London. We show that this approach provides better trade-off solutions in comparison to the minimum energy option, and how a combination of solutions over the lifetime of the network can enhance the overall minimum lifetime.",none
Two-level QoS-aware frame-based downlink resources allocation for RT/NRT services fairness in LTE networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11235-017-0289-0,3,article,ACM,2017,"In LTE, bandwidth resources allocation became a huge burden to be handled, as both of RT and NRT traffic should be processed fairly to satisfy their diverse QoS requirements. To tackle this issue in particular, in this work, we propose a fairness-based resources allocation method named Frame-based Game Theory (FGT), which can be flexibly implemented as an upper level in LTE downlink MAC layer; before the PRBs allocation function. Basically, FGT aim is to allow involved classes with different QoS requirements to fairly gain a part of the available channel resources to transmit their flows. Adhere, on every LTE-frame, a cooperative game scenario is designed. Wherein, Shapley formula is used to distribute the available amount of data within RT and NRT traffic classes. Then, conforming to these assigned resources portions to each traffic class, PRBs allocation process is triggered every TTI for the selected flows. In this work, we adopted some of the recent PRBs allocation methods as a lower level scheduler in order to illustrate a complete idea of MAC layer scheduling functions, and also to effectively evaluate FGT performance. Simulation results on various scenarios show that, fairness index for flows from different classes is increased when FGT is considered. The results also conveyed outperforming QoS indices for FGT on RT and NRT service in terms of throughput, PLR, as well as cell spectrum efficiency.",none
Optimal Spectrum Allocation Based on Primary User Activity Model in Cognitive Radio Wireless Sensor Networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11277-020-08009-3,0,research-article,ACM,2021,"In Cognitive Radio Wireless Sensor Networks, the licensed spectrum bands are highly dynamic, and their status varies overtime. With the expansion of these networks, regarding the energy constraints and the fact that reallocation of the frequency spectrum is energy-consuming, the problem of controlling the behavior of secondary users in the allocation of the spectrum is of great importance. Providing a method to reduce the number of channel reallocation, which in turn results in reducing energy consumption in such a dynamical network is essential. In this paper, considering the energy constraints, an optimal method for allocating frequency spectrum resources is presented using game theory and Nash equilibrium. By analyzing the activity model of primary users on the frequency spectrum and selecting the appropriate spectrum using the Nash equilibrium, the method reaches the network to a stationary equilibrium point. In these conditions, in addition to reducing interference between primary and secondary users, the number of channel reallocations by cognitive radio users is reduced and thus reduces overall energy consumption in the network and increases its life span.",none

Optimized cost effective and energy efficient routing protocol for wireless body area networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.adhoc.2017.03.008,19,research-article,ACM,2017,"The increase in average lifespan and huge costs for health treatments have resulted in cost effective solutions for healthcare management. Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) is a promising technology for delivering quality healthcare to its users. Low power devices attached to the body have limited battery life. It is desirable to have energy efficient routing protocols that maintain the required reliability value for sending the data from a given node to the sink. The current work proposes two protocols: Optimized Cost Effective and Energy Efficient Routing protocol (OCER) and Extended-OCER (E-OCER). In OCER, optimization using Genetic Algorithm (GA) is applied to the multi-objective cost function with residual energy, link reliability and path loss as its parameters for selecting the most optimal route from a given body coordinator to the sink. Distance between any two sensor nodes is reduced by applying multi-hop approach. E-OCER extends the work of OCER by considering inter-BAN communication.

A scalable support vector machine for distributed classification in ad hoc sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.neucom.2010.03.016,3,article,ACM,2010,"A scalable support vector machine (SVM) is proposed for distributed classification in ad hoc wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in this paper. The main idea is to train SVM classifier using only the local dataset, and evaluate the global nonlinear classifier via a dynamic consensus algorithm with communication only between neighbors instead of among all agents (sensor node) in the network. Specifically, by introducing a sequential gradient ascent based algorithm and modifying the formulation of the bias, the training process can be executed in a distributed and parallel way without information exchange among agents. After the distributed training of SVM, each node has one set of Lagrange multipliers corresponding to the local dataset. Then we adopt the dynamic consensus algorithm to evaluate the global nonlinear classifier for each agent in the network with only information exchange between neighbors. A novel dynamic consensus formulation is introduced and its convergence is proved. What's more, since it only exchanges information between neighbors during evaluation, the proposed algorithm is scalable for large-scale ad hoc sensor network and considerable communication energy can be reduced, which will prolong the lifetime of the whole network. Examples from the UCI repository demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",none
A study towards applying thermal inertia for energy conservation in rooms,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2529050,12,research-article,ACM,2013,"We are in an age where people are paying increasing attention to energy conservation around the world. The heating and air-conditioning systems of buildings introduce one of the largest chunks of energy expenses. In this article, we make a key observation that after a meeting or a class ends in a room, the indoor temperature will not immediately increase to the outdoor temperature. We call this phenomenon thermal inertia. Thus, if we arrange subsequent meetings in the same room rather than in a room that has not been used for some time, we can take advantage of such undissipated cool or heated air and conserve energy. Though many existing energy conservation solutions for buildings can intelligently turn off facilities when people are absent, we believe that understanding thermal inertia can lead system designs to go beyond on-and-off-based solutions to a wider realm.We propose a framework for exploring thermal inertia in room management. Our framework contains two components. (1) The energy-temperature correlation model captures the relation between indoor temperature change and energy consumption. (2) The energy-aware scheduling algorithms: given information for the relation between energy and temperature change, energy-aware scheduling algorithms arrange meetings not only based on common restrictions, such as meeting time and room capacity requirement, but also energy consumptions. We identify the interface between these components so further works towards same on direction can make efforts on individual components.We develop a system to verify our framework. First, it has a wireless sensor network to collect indoor, outdoor temperature and electricity expenses of the heating or air-conditioning devices. Second, we build an energy-temperature correlation model for the energy expenses and the corresponding room temperature. Third, we develop room scheduling algorithms. In detail, we first extend the current sensor hardware so that it can record the electricity expenses in re-heating or re-cooling a room. As the sensor network needs to work unattendedly, we develop a hardware board for long-range communications so that the Imote2 can send data to a remote server without a computer relay close by. An efficient two-tiered sensor network is developed with our extended Imote2 and TelosB sensors. We apply laws of thermodynamics and build a correlation model of the energy needed to re-cool a room to a target temperature. Such model requires parameter calibration and uses the data collected from the sensor network for model refinement. Armed with the energy-temperature correlation model, we develop an optimal algorithm for a specified case, and we further develop two fast heuristics for different practical scenarios.Our demo system is validated with real deployment of a sensor network for data collection and thermodynamics model calibration.

Many modern backbone networks leverage logically centralized controllers based on software-defined networking (SDN) to provide advance bandwidth reservation for data transfer requests. How to fully utilize the bandwidth resources of the links connecting data centers with guaranteed quality of service for each user request is an important problem for cloud service providers.

Load Balancing Technique for Congestion Control Multipath Routing Protocol in MANETs,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11277-016-3575-3,8,article,ACM,2017,"A mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is a collection of wireless mobile nodes that can communicate without a central controller or fixed infrastructure. Due to node mobility, designing a routing protocol to provide an efficient and suitable method to route the data with less energy consumption, packet drop and to prolong the network lifetime has become a challenging issue in MANETs. In MANETs, reducing energy consumption and packet loss involves congestion control and load balancing techniques. Thus, this paper introduces an efficient routing technique called the multipath load balancing technique for congestion control (MLBCC) in MANETs to efficiently balance the load among multiple paths by reducing the congestion. MLBCC introduces a congestion control mechanism and a load balancing mechanism during the data transmission process. The congestion control mechanism detects the congestion by using an arrival rate and an outgoing rate at a particular time interval T. The load balancing mechanism selects a gateway node by using the link cost and the path cost to efficiently distribute the load by selecting the most desirable paths. For an efficient flow of distribution, a node availability degree standard deviation parameter is introduced. Simulation results of MLBCC show the performance improvements in terms of the control overhead, packet delivery ratio, average delay and packet drop ratio in comparison with Fibonacci sequence multipath load balancing, stable backbone-based multipath routing protocol and ad hoc on demand multipath distance vector routing. In addition, the results show that MLBCC efficiently balances the load of the nodes in the network.",none
Scheduling for IEEE802.15.4-TSCH and slow channel hopping MAC in low power industrial wireless networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.comcom.2017.10.004,15,research-article,ACM,2017,"The so-called Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is expected to transform our world, and in depth modernize very different domains such as manufacturing, energy, agriculture, construction industry, and other industrial sectors. The need for low power radio networks first led to low duty cycle approaches where nodes turn off their radio chipset most of the time to save energy. The medium access control (MAC) has thus been largely investigated over the last fifteen years. Unfortunately, classical contention access methods use a random access and are unable to provide guarantees. In the meantime, some dedicated standards have emerged (e.g. IEEE 802.15.4-2006, IEEE 802.15.4-2015), combining Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) with slow channel hopping in order to enable reliability and energy efficiency. Slow channel hopping allows each node to use different channels for a frame and its possible retransmissions with a low-cost hardware. To provide high-reliability, these protocols rely on a common schedule in order to prevent simultaneously interfering transmissions. In this context, we clearly observe a strong growth of the number of proposals in the last years, denoting a strong interest of the research community for deterministic slow channel hopping scheduling for the IIoT.

This exponential growth in demand, both in terms of the number of devices and Quality of Service (QoS) had spawned the concept of cross-layer optimization several years ago. The primary goal of the cross-layer approach was to liberate the strict boundary between the layers of the traditional Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) protocol stack. The objective was to enable information flow between layers which then can be leveraged to optimize the network’s performance across the layers mitigating the challenges due to scarce resources while meeting QoS demands. The initial decade focused on establishing the theoretical feasibility of this revolutionary concept and gauging the effectiveness and limits of this idea. During the next phase, the advent of software defined radios (SDR) accelerated the growth of this domain due to its added flexibility. Even with the immense interest and progress in this area of research, there has been a gaping abyss between solutions designed in theory and ones deployed in practice. To establish this, we first present an elaborate survey of the cross-layer protocol stack literature with emphasis on their maturity scale.

A robust heuristic is proposed to use the history information in predicting the future traffic load on each street leading to an intersection controlled by a traffic light. The proposed algorithm is implemented and tested using MATLAB and the well-known traffic simulator, SUMO. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm optimizes the traffic flow up to 18% more than a standard traffic system.

Distributed Image Compression Architecture over Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1155/2017/5471721,6,research-article,ACM,2017,"In a wireless multimedia sensor network (WMSN), the minimization of network energy consumption is a crucial task not just for scalar data but also for multimedia. In this network, a camera node (CN) captures images and transmits them to a base station (BS). Several sensor nodes (SNs) are also placed throughout the network to facilitate the proper functioning of the network. Transmitting an image requires a large amount of energy due to the image size and distance; however, SNs are resource constrained. Image compression is used to scale down image size; however, it is accompanied by a computational complexity trade-off. Moreover, direct image transmission to a BS requires more energy. Thus, in this paper, we present a distributed image compression architecture over WMSN for prolonging the overall network lifetime (at high throughput). Our scheme consists of three subtasks: determining the optimal camera radius for prolonging the CN lifetime, distributing image compression tasks among the potential SNs to balance the energy, and, finally, adopting a multihop hierarchical routing scheme to reduce the long-distance transmission energy.

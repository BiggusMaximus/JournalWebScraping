"Reinforced covariance weighted mean of vectors optimizer: insight, diversity, deep analysis and feature selection",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s10489-023-05261-5,0,research-article,ACM,2024,"The WeIghted meaN oF vectOrs (INFO) algorithm is widely used as an efficient optimization tool due to its simple structure and superior performance. However, achieving a balance in solving complex high-dimensional problems is difficult and quickly falls into premature convergence or local optimality. To better balance the conflict between exploration and exploitation capabilities, a Q-learning Covariance weIghted meaN oF vectOrs Algorithm (QCINFOCMA) based on reinforcement learning is designed in this study to solve the global optimization problem. QCINFOCMA incorporates a covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy and Cauchy mutation as a new exploration scheme. The Q-learning strategy in reinforcement learning is also integrated into the original INFO to achieve adaptive switching between the original local search and the new exploration scheme. This allows search agents to use rewards and penalties to select exploration methods without following established models or strategies. In this study, a comprehensive analysis is conducted, pitting QCINFOCMA against 10 heuristics and 9 state-of-the-art algorithms, utilizing the IEEE CEC 2017 test functions. The experimental results show that QCINFOCMA outperforms other advanced algorithms in terms of convergence speed and convergence accuracy. Subsequently, QCINFOCMA was subjected to a discretization process, effectively transforming it into a binary tool through the application of a specific transformation function. This binary tool was then employed to address the real-world challenge of feature selection across a cohort of 36 datasets obtained from the UCI machine learning library. Empirical findings demonstrate that QCINFOCMA attains superior classification accuracy and requires fewer features in comparison to alternative optimization algorithms. The proposed QCINFOCMA can be a novel optimization tool for implementing global optimization and wrapper-based feature selection tasks.",none
"Multi-Hop and Mesh for LoRa Networks: Recent Advancements, Issues, and Recommended Applications",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3638241,1,survey,ACM,2024,"A comprehensive review is presented on the latest approaches to solutions focusing on multi-hop and mesh LoRa networks through the evaluation of simulations and real-world experiments, based on papers published between 2015 and 2023. The approaches are systematically classified into four (4) aspects: energy awareness, concurrent access and duty cycle regulations, routing protocols, and security. The first aspect encompasses parameter selection, distance, and clustering. The second aspect focuses on network segregation and time synchronisation. The third aspect covers proactive, reactive, and hybrid routing protocols. The aspect of security includes privacy and Denial-of-Service (DoS). Findings show a consensus that multi-hop networks and adherence to radio duty cycle are able to lower average power consumption. Concurrent access method can improve network performance, but more research is needed due to different conclusions. Reactive protocols have a slight advantage over proactive protocols in terms of node deployment scalability and lower power consumption due to less frequent routing table updates. Hybrid protocols are only beneficial in specific topology deployments. Security is still a major concern for LoRa networks, particularly on attacks such as Man-In-The-Middle (MITM), spoofing, wormholes, flooding, packet replay, and information disclosure. The upcoming trend of implementing machine learning algorithms to multi-hop and mesh LoRa networks opens up a wide range of possibilities, ranging from airspace efficiency, efficient route selection, and improving data throughput. A detailed discussion of the aspects’ issues and recommended industry applications that will benefit from multi-hop and mesh LoRa networks are also provided.",none
A Queuing Theory-Enabled Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation Algorithm for a Wired-Wireless Converged Network,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11277-013-1084-1,3,article,ACM,2013,"Multi-sink wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are being increasingly deployed in an ever-widening range of application scenarios, especially as they are reliable and exhibit low power consumption. Providing a backhaul for WSN traffic has become an important issue because the sensor data must usually be sent to the Internet or the core network. Passive optical networks (PONs) represent one next-generation access network technology which is appropriate for such a backhaul, however existing research appears to have concentrated on either WSN performance or PON performance, without considering the overall performance of both networks converged together. This paper proposes a new architecture which converges multi-sink WSNs and PONs, then provides a novel queuing-theory analysis of the converged network performance. Results from this analytical model are then used to motivate a new a DBA algorithm which optimizes grant size allocation. Numerical results show that this algorithm outperforms existing proposals when minimizing the system queue length in the converged network, while providing shorter end-to-end packet delay and higher throughput.

A multi-objective optimization framework for functional arrangement in smart floating cities,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.eswa.2023.121476,0,research-article,ACM,2024,"Before the terms “smart city” and “floating city” were introduced, the world's population had increased and land shortage across the world was already widely recognized. As a first challenge, the previous studies have developed the concept of a smart city as a creative answer, following that, several scientists proposed the floating city concept in the literature as a solution to the increased sea levels. Moreover, engineers, architects, and designers deal with city planning, for smart and floating settlements as a difficult design challenge, and evolutionary algorithms could be employed to address this complex problem by optimizing residents' needs. As a continuation of our previous studies on this topic, this time, we develop a multi-objective continuous genetic algorithm with differential evolution (DE) mutation strategy (MO_CGADE) and a multi-objective ensemble differential evolution algorithm (MO_EDE) to solve the problem on hand.

A novel energy efficient routing approach using multipath ring routing and clustering for WSN,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2381716.2381744,6,research-article,ACM,2012,"In this paper we have proposed a novel three phase approach for energy efficient routing using multipath routing and clustering technique. In Wireless sensor network (WSN), sensor node has limited battery supply and transmission range, so it can not directly communicate with sink node. Hence, multi-hop and multi-path communication is essential. In case of single path routing, if single node on a routing path dies then the whole communication will fail. Thus multi-path routing is more suitable to make the network fault tolerant. Here, we use multipath ring routing protocol in which multipath is available from all rings except ring R1, i.e. direct neighbour of sink node. We have used enhanced overlay scheme to provide the advantage of multipath routing to nodes of ring R1. To support scalability and remove redundancy of data, clustering is an effective technique to minimize network traffic which will ultimately improve network lifetime. We have used LEACH protocol for clustering. We have simulated proposed three phase approach using Castalia simulator. We observed that proposed approach is more energy efficient and robust in terms of data delivery than the multi-path ring routing.",none

Minimizing delay and maximizing lifetime for wireless sensor networks with anycast,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TNET.2009.2032294,32,article,ACM,2010,"In this paper, we are interested in minimizing the delay and maximizing the lifetime of event-driven wireless sensor networks for which events occur infrequently. In such systems, most of the energy is consumed when the radios are on, waiting for a packet to arrive. Sleep-wake scheduling is an effective mechanism to prolong the lifetime of these energy-constrained wireless sensor networks. However, sleep-wake scheduling could result in substantial delays because a transmitting node needs to wait for its next-hop relay node to wake up. An interesting line of work attempts to reduce these delays by developing ""anycast""-based packet forwarding schemes, where each node opportunistically forwards a packet to the first neighboring node that wakes up among multiple candidate nodes. In this paper, we first study how to optimize the anycast forwarding schemes for minimizing the expected packet-delivery delays from the sensor nodes to the sink. Based on this result, we then provide a solution to the joint control problem of how to optimally control the system parameters of the sleep-wake scheduling protocol and the anycast packet-forwarding protocol to maximize the network lifetime, subject to a constraint on the expected end-to-end packet-delivery delay. Our numerical results indicate that the proposed solution can outperform prior heuristic solutions in the literature, especially under practical scenarios where there are obstructions, e.g., a lake or a mountain, in the coverage area of the wireless sensor network.",none

In this paper, an informed or efficient energy approach is proposed for routing on the Internet of Things in which focus is on the sleep–wake schedule of nodes; therefore, a new optimization algorithm called chaos fuzzy grasshopper optimization algorithm was used. In chaos fuzzy grasshopper algorithm, the initial population of grasshoppers is generated by Lorenz chaos theory and the input and output parameters of the algorithm are adjusted by fuzzy approach. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method, three criteria of evaluation of remaining energy, network life and coverage rate were used. Investigating the findings in two different scenarios (efficiency over time and efficiency per number of different nodes) showed that the proposed method always is better than the base methods in all scenarios and for all performance evaluation criteria. So that in the study of the death of 30% of nodes which indicates the life of the network, results showed that the proposed method of the paper (FLGOA) has 9% better efficiency than FGOA, 12% better than GOA and 16% better than GSO.

A greedy perimeter stateless routing method based on a position prediction mechanism for flying ad hoc networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.jksuci.2023.101712,4,research-article,ACM,2023,"Today, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are very popular in military and commercial applications as well as academic research. Flying ad hoc network (FANET) is a new type of ad hoc network that organizes small drones in an ad hoc form. The movement in 3D space, high mobility, frequent topological changes, restricted resources, and low density are the features of these networks. These features cause serious challenges in designing an appropriate routing approach for these networks. In this paper, a greedy perimeter stateless routing method based on a position prediction mechanism called GPSR+ is proposed for FANETs. This scheme employs a position forecast strategy to approximate the future position of UAVs and modifies the propagation period of hello messages based on this strategy to achieve better adaptability to the dynamic network. In addition, GPSR+ chooses a set of candidate UAVs using a new method called the spherical removal technique to decide on the next-hop UAVs in the routing process. Finally, the most stable UAV toward the destination will be chosen from the candidate set to act as the next-hop. The simulation results show that GPSR+ grows the packet delivery ratio in FANET and extends network longevity because it increases path stability and improves energy consumption. However, the delay in GPSR+ is high.",none
Energy Optimization in Spectrum Sensing Using Cognitive Radio Wireless Sensor Networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11277-023-10839-w,0,research-article,ACM,2024,"Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have gained widespread adoption across various applications due to their capacity to collect and wirelessly transmit data. Cognitive Radio (CR) technology presents a promising solution for enhancing spectrum utilization efficiency within WSNs. The fusion of CR with WSNs results in Cognitive Radio Wireless Sensor Networks (CR-WSNs), capable of dynamically selecting optimal spectrum bands for seamless data transmission.

This study introduces an energy optimization technique specifically tailored for CR-WSNs, focusing on the crucial aspect of spectrum sensing. The proposed technique deploys a two-stage sensing strategy involving a primary sensor and a secondary sensor. The primary sensor identifies the presence of primary users in the spectrum band, activating the secondary sensor only when a primary user is detected. The secondary sensor conducts more detailed sensing to ascertain the available bandwidth for subsequent data transmission. Machine learning algorithms are employed in the proposed technique to finely tune the energy consumption of the CR-WSN during the spectrum sensing process. Through simulation assessments, the effectiveness of the proposed technique is gauged, revealing significant reductions in the energy consumption of the CR-WSN while upholding a high level of accuracy in spectrum sensing.

A Minimum Interference Cross-Layer Routing Protocol for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11277-013-1178-9,0,article,ACM,2013,"In mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), channel contention and packet collision can seriously affect the performance of routing protocols, which will eventually affect the performance of the whole network. Besides, the arbitrary mobility of nodes makes contention and collision ever-changing and more complex. Thus, it is imperative to analyze the problem of contention and collision so as to build appropriate routes in MANETs. In this paper, by respectively predicting the durations of the contention and collision at every hop along the route, a minimum interference cross-layer routing protocol (MI-CLR) is proposed based on Random Waypoint (RWP) model. The new protocol classifies the interference in the network into two types; the first type of interference can only affect channel contention, while the other affects both channel contention and packet collision. Via taking the two types of interference together into account, we propose a new routing metric to build routes which guarantees that the established routes will not break frequently while having the minimum interference. Simulation results show that the MI-CLR protocol can significantly improve the network performance such as the average end-to-end delay, the packet loss ratio, the routing overhead and the throughput.",none
A survey on opportunistic routing protocols in the Internet of Underwater Things,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.comnet.2023.109658,0,article,ACM,2023,"Compared with traditional ocean monitoring technologies, such as cable seabed observation networks, the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) can provide real-time underwater environment monitoring and improve efficiency of data collection. Data collection is one of the most essential functions of IoUT, while it is very challenging to achieve efficient data transmission in IoUT. Opportunistic routing is considered to have great advantages and potential in mitigating the drawbacks of underwater communication and improving the performance of data transmission. Therefore, in this paper, the opportunistic routing protocols for IoUT are reviewed and summarized. Taking advantage of the broadcast characteristic of wireless underwater communication, opportunistic routing selects a group of suitable neighbors as potential forwarders instead of selecting only one or a few specific next-hop nodes as in conventional routing, thus improving the success rate of data packet delivery. Critical to routing performance is which nodes participate in data forwarding as forwarders. The nodes act as forwarders are determined by user-defined routing parameters, which are referred to as route metrics in this paper. First, route metrics of opportunistic routing are analyzed and a comprehensive classification of opportunistic routing protocols is discussed based on the route metrics.

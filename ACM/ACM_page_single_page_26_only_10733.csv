"Resource Allocation and Task Scheduling in Fog Computing and Internet of Everything Environments: A Taxonomy, Review, and Future Directions",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3513002,65,survey,ACM,2022,"The Internet of Everything paradigm is being rapidly adopted in developing applications for different domains like smart agriculture, smart city, big data streaming, and so on. These IoE applications are leveraging cloud computing resources for execution. Fog computing, which emerged as an extension of cloud computing, supports mobility, heterogeneity, geographical distribution, context awareness, and services such as storage, processing, networking, and analytics on nearby fog nodes. The resource-limited, heterogeneous, dynamic, and uncertain fog environment makes task scheduling a great challenge that needs to be investigated. The article is motivated by this consideration and presents a systematic, comprehensive, and detailed comparative study by discussing the merits and demerits of different scheduling algorithms, focused optimization metrics, and evaluation tools in the fog computing and IoE environment. The goal of this survey article is fivefold. First, we review the fog computing and IoE paradigms. Second, we delineate the optimization metric engaged with fog computing and IoE environment. Third, we review, classify, and compare existing scheduling algorithms dealing with fog computing and IoE environment paradigms by leveraging some examples. Fourth, we rationalize the scheduling algorithms and point out the lesson learned from the survey. Fifth, we discuss the open issues and future research directions to improve scheduling in fog computing and the IoE environment.",none
TG-SPRED: Temporal Graph for Sensorial Data PREDiction,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3649892,0,research-article,ACM,2024,"This study introduces an innovative method aimed at reducing energy consumption in sensor networks by predicting sensor data, thereby extending the network’s operational lifespan. Our model, Temporal Graph Sensor Prediction (TG-SPRED), predicts readings for a subset of sensors designated to enter sleep mode in each time slot, based on a non-scheduling-dependent approach. This flexibility allows for extended sensor inactivity periods without compromising data accuracy. TG-SPRED addresses the complexities of event-based sensing—a domain that has been somewhat overlooked in existing literature—by recognizing and leveraging the inherent temporal and spatial correlations among events. It combines the strengths of Gated Recurrent Units and Graph Convolutional Networks to analyze temporal data and spatial relationships within the sensor network graph, where connections are defined by sensor proximities. An adversarial training mechanism, featuring a critic network employing the Wasserstein distance for performance measurement, further refines the predictive accuracy. Comparative analysis against six leading solutions using four critical metrics—F-score, energy consumption, network lifetime, and computational efficiency—showcases our approach’s superior performance in both accuracy and energy efficiency.",none
Efficient intelligent energy routing protocol in wireless sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1155/2015/618072,9,article,ACM,2015,"In wireless sensor networks energy is a very important issue because these networks consist of lowpower sensor nodes. This paper proposes a new protocol to reach energy efficiency. The protocol has a different priority in energy efficiency as reducing energy consumption in nodes, prolonging lifetime of the whole network, increasing system reliability, increasing the load balance of the network, and reducing packet delays in the network. In the new protocol is proposed an intelligent routing protocol algorithm. It is based on reinforcement learning techniques. In the first step of the protocol, a new clustering method is applied to the network and the network is established using a connected graph. Then data is transmitted using the Q-value parameter of reinforcement learning technique.

Q-learning based energy-efficient and void avoidance routing protocol for underwater acoustic sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.comnet.2021.108309,6,research-article,ACM,2021,"The routing in underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs) has become a challenging issue due to several problems. First, in UASN, the distance between the nodes changes due to their mobility with the water current, thus increasing the network’s energy consumption. Second problem in UASNs is the occurrence of the void hole, which affects the network’s performance. Because nodes are unable to deliver data towards the destination due to the absence of forwarder nodes (FNs) in the network. Thus, the objective of routing in UASNs is to overcome the issues mentioned earlier to prolong the network’s lifetime. Therefore, a Q-learning based energy-efficient and balanced data gathering (QL-EEBDG) routing protocol is proposed in this paper. In QL-EEBDG, the FNs are selected according to their residual energy and grouped according to their neighboring nodes’ energies. Using energy as the main selection parameter assures efficient energy consumption in the network. Moreover, efficient selection of the FNs increases the lifetime of the network. However, the void node recovery process fails when the topology of the network is changed. Therefore, to avoid void holes in QL-EEBDG, a QL-EEBDG adjacent node (QL-EEBDG-ADN) scheme is proposed. It finds alternate neighbor routes for packet transmission and ensures continuous communication in the network. Extensive simulations are carried out for the performance evaluation of the proposed technique with existing baseline protocols, namely efficient balanced energy consumption based data gathering (EBDG), enhanced EBDG (EEBDG) and QELAR. The performance parameters used in the simulations are network lifetime, energy tax, network stability period and packet delivery ratio (PDR). The simulation results depict that the proposed QL-EEBDG-ADN outperforms the baseline protocols by approximately 11% better PDR and 25% better energy tax.",none

The submarine sensor structures and intelligent underwater linked devices have been built into the IoT environment as the Internet of Underwater Things. Energy-sensitive and accurate data collection is carried out using extremely secure communications in underwater sensor networks that face major drawbacks like timing and place-dependent connectivity. Therefore in this paper, Optimized energy planning based intelligent data analytics has been proposed to offer a programming system for distributing intelligent data analytics underwater with high energy efficiency. IDA implements two stages: the first stage is to overcome a drawback caused by secret and expose terminals by a possibility-based disputing method. The second stage investigates the possibilities for slight specificity recovery by adding a space focused on transmitter and receiver. OEP is used to capture data through an activity that uses intelligent data focused on self-learning to identify highly secure and effective route directions across communication gaps in a sensor network. By balancing data traffic loading in a vast network, the OEP transport system minimizes greater energy usage and delay issues. In a controversial approach, IDA resolves a limitation of confidentiality and reveals terminals based on choice. OEP collects data via smart self-learning information to track safety and productive paths through connectivity holes in a sensor network.

A Survey on Real-Time Communications in Wireless Sensor Networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1155/2017/1864847,3,review-article,ACM,2017,"Generally, various traffic requirements in wireless sensor network are mostly dependent on specific application types, that is, event-driven, continuous, and query-driven types. In these applications, real-time delivery is one of the important research challenges. However, due to harsh networking environment around a node, many researchers usually take different approach from conventional networks. In order to discuss and analyze the advantage or disadvantage of these approaches, some comprehensive survey literatures were published; however they are either out of date or compiled for communication protocols on single layer.

Novel self-adaptive routing service algorithm for application in VANET,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s10489-018-1368-y,31,article,ACM,2019,"As a special MANET (mobile ad hoc network), VANET (vehicular ad-hoc network) has two important properties: the network topology changes frequently, and communication links are unreliable. Both properties are caused by vehicle mobility. To predict the reliability of links between vehicles effectively and design a reliable routing service protocol to meet various QoS application requirements, in this paper, details of the motion characteristics of vehicles and the reasons that cause links to go down are analyzed. Then a link duration model based on time duration is proposed. Link reliability is evaluated and used as a key parameter to design a new routing protocol. Quick changes in topology make it a huge challenge to find and maintain the end-to-end optimal path, but the heuristic Q-Learning algorithm can dynamically adjust the routing path through interaction with the surrounding environment. This paper proposes a reliable self-adaptive routing algorithm (RSAR) based on this heuristic service algorithm. By combining the reliability parameter and adjusting the heuristic function, RSAR achieves good performance with VANET. With the NS-2 simulator, RSAR performance is proved. The results show that RSAR is very useful for many VANET applications.",none

InRout - A QoS aware route selection algorithm for industrial wireless sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.adhoc.2011.07.015,9,article,ACM,2012,"Wireless sensor networks are a key enabling technology for industrial monitoring applications where the use of wireless infrastructure allows high adaptivity and low cost in terms of installation and retrofitting. To facilitate the move from the current wired designs to wireless designs, concerns regarding reliability must be satisfied. Current standardization efforts for industrial wireless systems lack specification on efficient routing protocols that mitigate reliability concerns. Consequently, this work presents the InRout route selection algorithm, where local information is shared among neighbouring nodes to enable efficient, distributed route selection while satisfying industrial application requirements and considering sensor node resource limitations. Route selection is described as a multi-armed bandit task and uses Q-learning techniques to obtain the best available solution with low overhead. A performance comparison with existing approaches demonstrates the benefits of the InRout algorithm, which satisfies typical quality of service requirements for industrial monitoring applications while considering sensor node resources. Simulation results show that InRout can provide gains ranging from 4% to 60% in the number of successfully delivered packets when compared to current approaches with much lower control overhead.",none
A survey on event-driven and query-driven hierarchical routing protocols for mobile sink-based wireless sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11227-022-04327-4,5,research-article,ACM,2022,"The sink mobility in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) brings new challenges specifically while designing the routing protocols. The advertisement of the mobile sink location to the sensor nodes is one of these challenges that is a core problem for any routing protocol. To deal with this issue, several hierarchical routing protocols have been developed for different mode of data transmissions, i.e., event-driven and query-driven, in mobile sink-based WSNs (MSWSNs). A routing protocol considers a particular data transmission mode depending on the application requirement. Routing protocols designed for event-driven scenarios do not ensure their efficient working in query-driven scenarios and vice versa. Thus, each application requires some specific designing of routing protocol. By considering the impact of data transmission mode on routing protocols, this paper makes the very first attempt to provide a comprehensive survey on hierarchical routing protocols designed for query-driven and event-driven data transmission scenarios. We provide a comparative study by discussing and describing their functionalities along with their advantages, disadvantages and key performance parameters.

In response to those challenges, we present SAS-TDMA, a source-aware scheduling algorithm. It is a cross-layer solution which adapts itself to network dynamics. It realizes a trade-off between scheduling length and its configurational overhead incurred by rapid responses to routes changes. We implemented a TDMA stack instead of the default CSMA stack and introduced a cross-layer for scheduling in TOSSIM, the TinyOS simulator.

Machine learning for wireless communications in the Internet of Things: A comprehensive survey,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.adhoc.2019.101913,30,research-article,ACM,2019,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to require more effective and efficient wireless communications than ever before. For this reason, techniques such as spectrum sharing, dynamic spectrum access, extraction of signal intelligence and optimized routing will soon become essential components of the IoT wireless communication paradigm. In this vision, IoT devices must be able to not only learn to autonomously extract spectrum knowledge on-the-fly from the network but also leverage such knowledge to dynamically change appropriate wireless parameters (e.g., frequency band, symbol modulation, coding rate, route selection, etc.) to reach the network’s optimal operating point. Given that the majority of the IoT will be composed of tiny, mobile, and energy-constrained devices, traditional techniques based on a priori network optimization may not be suitable, since (i) an accurate model of the environment may not be readily available in practical scenarios; (ii) the computational requirements of traditional optimization techniques may prove unbearable for IoT devices. To address the above challenges, much research has been devoted to exploring the use of machine learning to address problems in the IoT wireless communications domain.

A Hybrid Routing Protocol to Establish Communication in Mobility Cast Using Mobility Pattern,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11277-024-11081-8,0,research-article,ACM,2024,"In the opportunistic network, communication between two communities is challenging and time-consuming. A community is made up of several nodes that are grouped together according to distinct behaviors. This attribute is known as the mobility pattern of the nodes. Mobility-casting is the process of gathering nodes according to a common mobility pattern. A community is made up of many casts. It is extremely hard to locate both a local and global forwarder for the message transfer inside the community. Due to the absence of information on the path between the source and the destination, particularly in diverse landscapes with both sparse and dense populations, searching for a destination might take a long time. When a user U, of a particular community sends a message, it is received by users in community B who have the same cast and mobility pattern as U (referred to as social friends collectively).

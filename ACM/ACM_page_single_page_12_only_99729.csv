DA-DRLS: Drift adaptive deep reinforcement learning based scheduling for IoT resource management,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.jnca.2019.04.010,1,research-article,ACM,2019,"In order to fulfill the tremendous resource demand by diverse IoT applications, the large-scale resource-constrained IoT ecosystem requires a robust resource management technique. An optimal resource provisioning in IoT ecosystem deals with an efficient request-resource mapping which is difficult to achieve due to the heterogeneity and dynamicity of IoT resources and IoT requests. In this paper, we investigate the scheduling and resource allocation problem for dynamic user requests with varying resource requirements. Specifically, we formulate the complete problem as an optimization problem and try to generate an optimal policy with the objectives to minimize the overall energy consumption and to achieve a long-term user satisfaction through minimum response time. We introduce the paradigm of a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) mechanism to escalate the resource management efficiency in IoT ecosystem. To maximize the numerical performance of the entire resource management activities, our method learns to select the optimal resource allocation policy among a number of possible solutions. Moreover, the proposed approach can efficiently handle a sudden hike or fall in users' demand, which we call demand drift, through adaptive learning maintaining the optimal resource utilization. Finally, our simulation analysis illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism as it achieves substantial improvements in various factors, like reducing energy consumption and response time by at least 36.7% and 59.7% respectively and increasing average resource utilization by at least 10.4%. Our approach also attains a good convergence and a trade-off between the monitoring metrics.Graphical abstractDisplay OmittedHighlights•Heterogeneous resource demand by continuously arriving Internet of Things applications' requests.•Reduction of response time and energy consumption while satisfying varying user demands.•Drift handling in request arrival patterns through adaptive learning.•Trade-off analysis between different monitoring metrics.•Early convergence with a high resource utilization.",none
Enhanced traffic-adaptive slotted MAC for IoT-based smart monitoring grid,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11227-020-03588-1,0,research-article,ACM,2021,"The implementation of a wireless sensor network has been utilized in many applications of urban and rural areas. One such application is smart-grid Internet of Things, (IoT)-based monitoring systems that work on real-time communication. They require an intelligent scheduling mechanism to scrap delay in dynamic traffic flows without undergoing any efficiency loss. This study presents a data-driven TDMA-based paradigm, called traffic-adaptive slot-assignment MAC (TASA-MAC) that supports IoT-channel dynamics in time-critical large-scale monitoring systems while combating the packet delay. The proposed work showcases low run-time scheduler-complexity for low-cost end nodes independent of the network’s scalability owing to TASA-MAC’s optimal fitness-function parameters under intermittent IoT-traffic scenarios, i.e., energy cost and residual energy ratio. The proposed scheduler minimizes the delay of exigency packets while also prompts the system to deliver them before their deadline expiry. The analytical and simulation model of TASA-MAC demonstrates its superiority in terms of moderated delay, packet throughput, and energy demand as compared to the existing models.",none

Energy Efficient Routing Technique for Wireless Sensor Networks Using Ant-Colony Optimization,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11277-020-07539-0,3,research-article,ACM,2020,"Wireless sensor networks (WSN) consists of numerous number of nodes fitted with energy reserves to collect large amount of data from the environment on which it is deployed. Energy conservation has huge importance in wsn since it is virtually impossible to recharge the nodes in their remote deployment. Forwarding the collected data from nodes to the base station requires considerable amount of energy. Hence efficient routing protocols should be used in forwarding the data to the base station in order to minimize the energy consumption thereby increasing the life-time of the network. In this proposed routing protocol, we consider a hierarchical routing architecture in which nodes in the outer-level forwards data to the inner-level nodes. Here we optimized the routing path using ant-colonies where data moves along minimal congested path. Further, when ant-colony optimization is used, certain cluster-head nodes may get overloaded with data forwarding resulting in early death due to lack of energy. To overcome this anomaly, we estimated the amount of data a neighboring Cluster-head can forward based on their residual energy. We compared the energy consumption results of this proposed Routing using Ant Colony Optimization (RACO) with other existing clustering protocols and found that this system conserves more energy thereby increasing lifetime of the network.",none

Adaptive clustering routing protocol for underwater sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.adhoc.2022.102953,5,research-article,ACM,2022,"In underwater sensor networks, the limited energy of sensor nodes and the difficulty of replacing the power supply means that one faulty node will severely affect the lifetime of the entire network. The design of energy-saving and efficient routing protocols is the key to prolonging the network lifetime. This paper describes an adaptive clustering routing protocol for underwater sensor networks based on multi-agent reinforcement learning. The proposed protocol models the network as a multi-agent system, and allows the nodes to select the global optimal route collaboratively through reinforcement learning. To reduce the probability of hotspots generation, an adaptive cluster head selection algorithm that does not incur any additional communication overhead and does not require consensus from surrounding nodes is proposed, which enables nodes to autonomously decide whether they can act as cluster heads using routing and environment information. Additionally, a biased reward function is designed to feedback the effect of the adaptive cluster head selection algorithm on the routing performance and to encourage the nodes to select the cluster heads as relays.

It consists of several acoustic channels, sink nodes, sensor nodes and base stations. Source nodes are deployed at different depth levels of oceans for monitoring purposes.

The main thing is that the different powers supplied to the nodes cause the diversity. These nodes detect physical condition checks and send them from source to destination. Therefore, the main concern of WSN is the Energy consumption of the node sending data to cluster head. The energy consumption is limited, and the terminal must make the maximum number of transmissions and maintain clustering to maximize the terminal's life. There are many clustering algorithms like low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy, ad-hoc on-demand distance vector.

This paper therefore proposes an optimisation approach that uses self-learning techniques to automatically learn the optimal combination of services and/or protocols in each individual network. We introduce tools capable of discovering this optimal set of services and protocols for any given set of co-located heterogeneous sensor networks. These tools eliminate the need for manual reconfiguration while only requiring minimal a priori knowledge about the network.

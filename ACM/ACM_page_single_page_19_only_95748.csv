"Integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with sensor networks: Trends, challenges, and future directions",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.jksuci.2023.101892,0,review-article,ACM,2024,"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have become widely ubiquitous deployed in many application domains over the past few decades. Classical approaches configure WSNs statically which makes altering and re-configuring them dynamically a challenging task. To address this challenge, Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies could be integrated into WSNs. The utilization of AI systems holds the potential to enhance the efficient management of energy consumption, thereby preventing wastage and ensuring prolonged usage in WSN. This research investigates the application of AI, encompassing intelligent computing techniques such as Machine Learning, to promote sustainable energy practices, with a particular focus on Internet of Things (IoT) devices. We explores various methodologies employed in AI, including supervised and unsupervised learning, as well as reinforcement learning, within the context of existing practices. The primary objective is to provide insights for researchers seeking to comprehend recent advancements in employing AI for sustainable energy of WSNs. Additionally, the article addresses persistent challenges and issues that require attention and optimal solutions in this domain. As such, we provide an in-depth analysis of various recently proposed AI strategies (2007 to 2023) that have been applied to WSNs. The examined articles have been systematically arranged to enhance follow-through, clarity, and readability. Furthermore, we discuss the benefits and drawbacks of the (AI) techniques employed in WSNs. Finally, we discuss future research opportunities that would enable scalable and cost-effective AI deployment in WSNs.",none
A Q-Learning-based distributed routing protocol for frequency-switchable magnetic induction-based wireless underground sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.future.2022.10.004,8,research-article,ACM,2023,"Magnetic Induction (MI) based Wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs) consist of magnetic-antenna sensors that are buried in and communicate through soil, considered as part of full-coverage 6G wireless system. The wireless channel in MI-WUSNs appears a considerable frequency-selective property due to those conductivity objects in underground environment. This results in that a single frequency is almost impossible to ensure that all sensors in MI-WUSNs are both connected. To this end, the frequency-switch strategy is introduced into MI-WUSNs to cope with its frequency-selective property and ensure network connectivity, forming frequency-switchable MI-WUSNs. In this paper, the distributed routing protocol for frequency-switchable MI-WUSNs is studied to contribute to the network design of underground wireless systems. To be specific, we first map the frequency-switchable MI-WUSN to a multi-layer network and give a description about its routing decision in the Q-Learning framework. Then, we discuss several special designs in system implementation for the proposed routing protocol. In addition, simulation experiments are also considered to verify the convergence and effectiveness of our routing protocol.Highlights•Frequency-switch strategy is introduced into MI-WUSNs.•Kernel regression method is applied to accomplish the adaptive frequency selection in frequency-switchable MI-WUSN.•Several special designs in system implementation are proposed for the distributed routing protocol.•Simulation results reveal the effectiveness and adaptivity of our routing protocol.",none
Power-aware agent-solution for information communication in WSN,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11235-010-9347-6,0,article,ACM,2011,"The information-communication in an energy efficient and scalable manner in a wireless sensor network is a basic need. In this work, we use the multi-agent approach in order to build an Information Importance Based Communication (IIBC) for large scale wireless sensor network data processing. A multi-agent cooperation can be used to greatly reduce the communication cost, especially over low bandwidth links, by treating data cooperatively in sensor nodes rather than bringing this data to a central processor. The principal goal of our proposition is to maximize the wireless sensor network life time and simultaneously to insure a sufficient level of performance in term of latency, packet loss and reliability. Through successive simulations, IIBC proved its ability to reduce the power consumption of the sensor node to maximize ""the mean time to first network partition"" in several network densities and scales.",none
Enhancing privacy for ad hoc systems with predeployment key distribution,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.adhoc.2017.01.003,2,research-article,ACM,2017,"Achieving security in distributed systems of constrained devices (like Wireless Sensor Networks) requires methods that can be performed while very limited computational, memory and communication resources are available. Moreover, while designing security protocols one needs take into account the adversary that can eavesdrop communication or compromise some of the devices. To achieve some level of security, two communicating devices need to establish a communication key. In the setting of severely constrained devices traditional methods are infeasible due to resource limitations, and one has to incorporate other security providing methods. One of the first such protocols has been introduced in Eschenauer and Gligor [23]. The paper followed by dozens of others relies on probabilistic key sharing among the nodes before deployment (key predistribution) in the Ad Hoc environment.In our paper, we show that regular protocols of key predistribution designed primarily for providing confidentiality of communication do not provide privacy in many natural scenarios. More precisely, even a weak adversary may link transmissions of the same nodes. In particular even a passive adversary that is eavesdropping the communication can easily recognize whether the same devices start communication several times. Such information not only breaches nodes privacy but also can be a starting point for an more advanced attacks and can give significant information about networks activity. We define several models of adversary and introduce some general methods that can be used for addressing this issue. For the model with weaker adversary we show how to fully secure the privacy in an efficient manner. For the case of stronger adversary, we propose a method based on local key exchange allowing mitigation of the privacy threat.",none
ETERS: A comprehensive energy aware trust-based efficient routing scheme for adversarial WSNs,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.future.2021.06.049,10,research-article,ACM,2021,"Trust-based secure routing schemes are more effective than cryptographic routing protocols to convey energy-efficient data in WSNs since cryptographic protocols require high computation, more convergence time as well as storage space. The paper presents a well-organized trust estimation-based routing scheme (ETERS) that consists multi-trust (communication trust, energy trust, data trust) approach to alleviate several internal attacks like badmouthing, Sybil, selective forwarding, on–off,​ black hole, and gray-hole attacks for clustered WSN. The proposed multi-trust approach is used to analyze the credibility of sensitive monitored data. A novel and efficient cluster head selection algorithm (ECHSA) is employed to improve the performance of the cluster head (CH) selection process in clustered WSN. ECHSA allows the facility to elect a robust CH after a certain period to perform an equal load balance on all CHs. ETERS utilizes the Beta distribution-based trust function because recovery of trust values under attacks is faster in Beta distribution than Gaussian and Dirichlet distribution. ETERS also incorporates an irregular attenuation factor during the evaluation of communication trust to reflect the effect of various external factors such as natural calamity (earthquake), network congestion, etc., based on the trust values. However, a trust-based attack detection algorithm (TADA) assesses the reliability of SNs to detect internal attacks. TADA employs IDs, locations, and triple trust to detect internal attacks. Additionally, the proposed trust system employs an adjustable dynamic sliding length logical timing window to eradicate the limitations of existing trust models. Furthermore, a trust-based secure routing algorithm is incorporated to dynamically detect misbehavior in terms of packet forwarding for energy-efficient communication among sensor nodes. ETERS is compared with QEBSR, ATRP, ELPC, and SQEER to examine its performance. Experimental results on the MATLAB simulation platform exhibit excellent performance in terms of severity analysis, attack detection, and prevention to protect WSN, energy consumption under (i) normal (ii) attack scenario, latency (in sec.), packet delivery ratio (PDR), and throughput (in %) in the existence of spiteful nodes.Highlights•Present motivation and vision for WSNs.•Present a comprehensive, scalable, realistic multi-trust model highly suitable for alleviating internal attacks in WSNs.•Emphasize on the strength of the weighted approach and Beta distribution.•Efficiently identify (defend) selfish SNs and provide prevention by employing flexible punishment coefficient that can be tuned according to application requirement.•Aim to provide the adaptability of various environmental conditions into a trust-based routing scheme according to system requirements.",none
Robustness of Middleware Communication in Contested and Dynamic Environments,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3586210.3586382,0,research-article,ACM,2023,"Contested and dynamic environments with poor and unreliable network conditions are often encountered by military operations or crisis management systems. While it is a common occurrence for networks to behave poorly, or for system nodes to malfunction, most existing decision making algorithms have only been tested in perfect conditions. In this paper, we present an analysis of the robustness of reinforcement learning and evolutionary approaches employed in a communication middleware that operates in a contested environment. The SMARTNet middleware prioritizes and controls the messages sent by each node, with the aim of preserving network bandwidth.

A load-balanced data aggregation scheduling for duty-cycled wireless sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/CloudCom.2012.6427533,0,Article,ACM,2012,"To bridge the gap between limited energy supplies of the sensor nodes and the system lifetime, duty-cycle Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) with data aggregation are studied in this paper. We proposed a load-balanced and latency-efficient data aggregation scheduling for duty-cycled WSNs. A shortest path tree (SPT) is used as the routing structure for data aggregation scheduling. In SPT, parent-children assignments are well-designed to assign nodes from level h+1 to the parents at level h such that every parent has a balanced load, while reducing the sleep latency which is a period of time for a sender to wait for its parent to be active. Finally, through the simulation and comparisons, we prove the effectiveness of our approach.",none
Graph Neural Networks in IoT: A Survey,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3565973,31,research-article,ACM,2023,"The Internet of Things (IoT) boom has revolutionized almost every corner of people’s daily lives: healthcare, environment, transportation, manufacturing, supply chain, and so on.

Cluster-Based Classical Routing Protocols and Authentication Algorithms in WSN: A Survey Based on Procedures and Methods,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11277-021-09265-7,2,review-article,ACM,2022,"Wireless sensor system (WSN) is an assortment of miniature sensor knobs with some limitations.

Controlling Mobile Sink Trajectory for Data Harvesting in Wireless Sensor Networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11277-016-3383-9,0,article,ACM,2016,"This paper proposes a mathematical optimization model to maximize the lifetime of wireless sensor networks through determining the optimal trajectory (OT) of mobile sink (MS). We address deadline and event based applications where by capturing an event, a sensor node has to send its data to MS in a restricted time slot defined as a deadline. We demonstrate that the addressed problem is in NP-hard form and then by dividing the problem into two phases, we propose a heuristic approach based on mathematical optimization. In the first phase, the trajectory of MS is determined through proposing a convex mathematical optimization model; in this step, we specify an optimal line as OT with respect to the current location and constant velocity of MS; moreover, the volume of captured data by sensor nodes, deadline and geographical locations of sensor nodes are taken into account. We extend our work in the second phase by proposing a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model to relax the constant velocity assumption of MS. To obtain an optimal solution of MILP, subsequently a tabu-based algorithm is proposed. The effectiveness of our approach is validated via the extensive number of simulation runs and comparison with other proposed algorithms.",none
A scalable joint routing and scheduling scheme for large-scale wireless sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.adhoc.2012.07.004,3,article,ACM,2013,"The multihop configuration of a large-scale wireless sensor network enables multiple simultaneous transmissions without interference within the network. Existing time division multiple access (TDMA) scheduling schemes exploit gain based on the assumption that the path is optimally determined by a routing protocol. In contrast, our scheme jointly considers routing and scheduling and introduces several new concepts. We model a large-scale wireless sensor network as a tiered graph relative to its distance from the sink, and introduce the notion of relay graph and relay factor to direct the next-hop candidates toward the sink fairly and efficiently. The sink develops a transmission and reception schedule for the sensor nodes based on the tiered graph search for a set of nodes that can simultaneously transmit and receive. The resulting schedule eventually allows data from each sensor node to be delivered to the sink. We analyze our scheduling algorithm both numerically and by simulation, and we discuss the impact of protocol parameters. Further, we prove that our scheme is scalable to the number of nodes, from the perspectives of mean channel capacity and maximum number of concurrent transmission nodes. Compared with the existing TDMA scheduling schemes, our scheme shows better performance in network throughput, path length, end-to-end delay, and fairness index.",none
Joint dynamic routing and resource allocation in satellite-terrestrial integrated networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.comnet.2023.109823,0,research-article,ACM,2023,"The Satellite-Terrestrial Integrated Networks (STINs) is considered as a reliable and agile next-generation communication network scheme, because it is flexible to deploy and robust to disasters (e.g., earthquakes, floods, and volcanic eruptions). The routing and resource allocation directly affect the power consumption of satellites in the STINs. However, most of existing research works study these two issues separately, and neglect the impact of path selection on the satellite power consumption. This paper investigates the joint optimization problem of routing, bandwidth allocation, user association, channel allocation, and power allocation of the STINs. We aim at minimizing satellites’ power consumption while satisfying user's Quality of Service (QoS). Because the power consumption of satellites for routing in the space segment is involved with the data rate through satellite gateways in the user segment, this optimization problem is a Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) problem. To this end, we convert the MOO problem to a Single-Objective Optimization (SOO) problem by linear weighted method. Considering that the SOO problem is a Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem, we decompose it into the resource allocation sub-problem in the user segment and the routing optimization sub-problem in the space segment. And we solve these two sub-problems iteratively. Specifically, we convert the first sub-problem into a convex optimization problem and obtain the current user association and channel allocation. Then we formulate the second sub-problem into a multi-commodity flow problem and solve it based on the obtained user association and channel allocation. The SOO problem is solved by iteratively optimizing these two sub-problems. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm is able to get an approximate optimal solution quickly and effectively reduce the power consumption of satellites compared with benchmark algorithms in the STINs.",none
Effective cluster scheduling scheme using local gravitation method for wireless sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.eswa.2023.121006,0,research-article,ACM,2023,"Ensuring a certain clustering of distributed sensor nodes is significant for energy efficiency of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Recently, several energy efficient artificial intelligence based-methods that provide cluster scheduling schemes have been proposed. However, there are few methods providing balanced energy exhausting of the number of nodes in clusters. In this paper, we present a novel cluster scheduling scheme for WSNs using local gravitational method to adaptively determine the number of time-varying clusters based on a sequence of vectors. The main idea in this method is to be inspired by the physical features of gravity force among the mass units. These features are considered to be units of mass of nodes in vector space. It is based on the fact that with clustering, the highest gravitational force on moving the units of mass is applied by the area with feature vectors that are high-density. Cooperative and distributed clustering is formed and the number of clusters is found by sharing the gravitational force between neighboring nodes through a distribution-optimization scheme. The results of this study have been compared with the existing methods in various scenarios and with many performance criteria through the Matlab programming. Especially in dense networks, the proposed algorithm has increased the number of clusters and ensured the clustering balance as much as possible.

Energy-efficient routing protocol for underwater wireless sensor networks using a hybrid metaheuristic algorithm,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.engappai.2024.108132,0,research-article,ACM,2024,"Energy-efficient routing protocols for Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs) have become critical in recent years for the intelligent and reliable collection of data from the seas and oceans. UWSNs are a group of deep-water sensors that are used for marine exploration and ocean surveillance. This network is used to route data collected by sensors deployed at different water depths to surface water sensors (sinks). Transmitting the collected data from the ocean's depths to the surface is difficult due to the limited available bandwidth, inconvenient location, high mobility of the sensors, and, most importantly, limited energy. The purpose of this paper is to present a routing protocol that improves the reliability of data transmission from a source sensor to a destination sensor. A hybrid metaheuristic algorithm called GSLS is proposed to use in this protocol, which combines a Global Search Algorithm (GSA) and a Local Search Algorithm (LSA). The proposed GSA is an algorithm inspired by several of the Genetic Algorithm's (GAs) solution updating properties. The proposed LSA algorithm is an extension of the scattered search algorithm. The proposed GSA and LSA are combined in parallel to search the problem's space simultaneously to find an optimal path in an acceptable time. as a result, more problem area is examined, and the algorithm's run time to find the best route is reduced.

Energy-Aware Link Scheduling Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11277-014-1865-1,0,article,ACM,2014,"By reducing interferences drastically, time division multiple access (TDMA) based approaches are considered one of the most efficient solutions to optimize resources' use. The existing protocols, however, address only the latency minimization without considering the waste of energy, which typically results from idle listening or frequent transitions of the radio module between sleep and active modes. Besides, only saturated systems are considered in these protocols, which may imply resources' underutilization in some practical use cases. In this paper, we present an energy-aware TDMA-based link scheduling protocol, named deterministic link scheduling protocol (DLSP), designed with the aim of achieving both low energy consumption and low latency in wireless sensor networks. DLSP takes advantage of the spatial reuse of interference-free time slots using conflict graphs. Unlike earlier studies that often considered saturated traffic, we propose to relax the saturation assumption in order to maintain good performance when some of the nodes have no data to send. Thus, we propose to define the following transmission periods: a period to send the own data of the nodes and a period to relay packets. The simulation results clearly show the effectiveness of the proposed protocol, in terms of latency and energy consumption, compared to existing approaches.",none

AR-GAIL: Adaptive routing protocol for FANETs using generative adversarial imitation learning,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.comnet.2022.109382,1,research-article,ACM,2022,"Flying ad hoc networks (FANETs), as the emerging communication paradigm, have been widely used in civil and military fields. Packet routing in FANETs is challenging due to dynamic network conditions. Traditional topology-based routing protocols are unsuitable for FANETs with dynamic network topologies. Routing protocols based on reinforcement learning (RL) may be the first choice for FANETs because of their good learning ability. However, existing RL-based routing protocols for FANETs have limited adaptability to network dynamics due to ignoring neighborhood environment states, and are prone to get stuck in suboptimal routing policies owing to inappropriate reward design and delayed reward issues. We propose AR-GAIL, an adaptive routing protocol based on Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL), which aims to select the minimal end-to-end delay route according to ongoing network conditions for FANETs. We formulate the routing decision process as a Markov decision process (MDP) and design a novel MDP state which consists of the current node state and the neighborhood environment state. Moreover, we develop an efficient value function-based GAIL learning framework to learn the routing policy from expert routes instead of a predefined reward function. The simulation shows that AR-GAIL can adapt well to network dynamics. Compared with state-of-the-art routing protocols, AR-GAIL shows outstanding performance in terms of the end-to-end delay and packet delivery ratio.",none
Hybrid Deep Learning Approach for Improved Network Connectivity in Wireless Sensor Networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11277-022-10052-1,0,research-article,ACM,2022,"Wireless sensor networks occupy a prominent role in industrial as well as scientific applications. Lifetime enhancement and coverage are the major factors considered while designing the network. Various research models are evolved by considering the scheduling and routing process to solve the network lifetime issues. However, coverage and connectivity is another important factor that affects the lifetime of the remaining nodes. When a large number of sensors are deployed randomly, scheduling is preferred to enhance the network lifetime, but it leads to coverage issues. Other than scheduling, node damage, battery exhaustion, software and hardware failures might lead to coverage issues. Preserving the network connectivity while maximizing the network coverage is a crucial task in wireless sensor networks.

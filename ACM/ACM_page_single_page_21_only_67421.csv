An Efficient Scheduling Algorithm for Data Collection through Multi-path Routing Structures in Wireless Sensor Networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/MSN.2010.16,2,Article,ACM,2010,"Multi-path routing is essential in wireless sensor data collection to overcome the high loss rates in wireless environments. In this paper, we propose an efficient distributed scheduling algorithm for data collection through multi-path routing structures in wireless sensor networks. The message complexity of the proposed scheduling algorithm is O(n(D+3)), where n is the number of sensor nodes in the network and D is the maximum node degree. The best existing scheduling algorithm for single-path routing structures has the message complexity of O(n(X+D+2)), where X is the number of 2-hop neighbors of a sensor node. The complexity of the proposed scheduling algorithm is a significant improvement since D is substantially smaller than X. In addition, we also develop a method for deriving a super lower bound on the shortest possible length of the data collection schedule generated by any algorithm. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed scheduling algorithm produces good data collection schedules with greatly reduced running time and less scheduling messages generated as compared to existing algorithms. The length of the data collection schedule produced by our algorithm is within 2.3 times of the lower bound estimate across a wide range of network settings.",none
An optimal cluster formation based energy efficient dynamic scheduling hybrid MAC protocol for heavy traffic load in wireless sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.cose.2018.04.009,30,research-article,ACM,2018,"This article proposes an Energy Efficient Dynamic Scheduling Hybrid MAC Protocol (EDS-MAC) for Traffic Adaptive Wireless Sensor Networks. The proposed approach consists of two stages. (i) cluster formation, and (ii) data transmission. In the first stage, a variable step size firefly algorithm (VSSFFA) is proposed for generating energy-aware clusters by optimal selection of cluster heads. The VSSFFA reduces the cost of locating optimal position for the head nodes in a cluster. Additionally, we proposed the VSSFFA-based approach within the cluster rather than base station, which makes it a semi-distributed method. The selection criteria of the objective function are based on the residual energy, intra-cluster distance, node degree and head count of the probable cluster heads. Data communication is done using data transmission stage, which reduces the latency, delay, and control overhead. Compared to IH-MAC, EDS-MAC reduces the size of control packet by introducing short node address (1 byte instead of 8 bytes in IH-MAC). By enabling lower duty cycle operation and by performing efficient clustering, it reduces overhearing and reduces the overall latency experienced by the sensor network. Hence, introduction of EDS-MAC protocol in WSN can help the users with prolonged network life span and minimize the energy and overhead utilization of the overall network. The efficiency of the proposed MAC protocol has been analyzed using the NS-2 simulator. WSN employing EDS-MAC is compared with IH-MAC and is found to experience 50% reduction in overall energy consumption and 72% reduction in overall delay experienced by the network.",none
A survey on routing protocols for wireless sensor networks using swarm intelligence,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1504/IJITST.2016.078574,6,article,ACM,2016,"Efficient routing is an important issue for the design of wireless sensor network WSN protocols to meet the severe hardware and resource constraints. Swarm intelligence is a relatively novel field. It comes under intelligent routing protocols which contribute to the optimisation of wireless sensor networks.

A Task-Oriented Hybrid Routing Approach based on Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.comcom.2023.07.040,0,research-article,ACM,2023,"With the development of communication and transmission technologies, the applications of Internet of Things (IoT) and telemedicine are increasingly sensitive to network latency. To meet this urgent demand, learning-based routing approaches emerge, with better performance and higher flexibility. These routing approaches can be divided into single-path and multipath, which have lower transmission delay and better load balancing respectively. However, the traffic scheduling policy is not only affected by the network states but also needs to consider the requirements for traffic tasks. We propose a Task-Oriented Hybrid Routing Approach (TOHRA) based on Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) in Software-Defined Networking (SDN). First, the hybrid routing optimization algorithm comprehensively considers the network states and task requirements, and outputs a task-oriented hybrid routing that combines the advantages of single-path and multipath. Moreover, we design a hop-by-hop traffic segmentation model based on DDPG to output the traffic segmentation ratio on hybrid routing to adapt to the changing transmission path. Experimental results show that TOHRA achieves the best performance of load balancing and network throughput. Especially in the case of Type C tasks in Germany topology, the average network throughput of THORA is increased by 32.86%, and the average variance of link load rate is reduced by 46.62%.",none

An efficient Markov energy predictor for software defined wireless sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11276-022-03058-x,0,research-article,ACM,2022,"Software-defined wireless sensor networks (SDWSNs) are a great step forward to centralize and facilitate the management of low-power networks. However, the continuous sending of local information from the sensor nodes to the controller causes excessive energy loss and increases the network overhead. This dilemma has become one of the hot topics of current research to make SDWSNs more efficient. This paper has proposed an efficient energy predictor for SDWSNs (E2-SDWSN) to improve the performance of the sensor network. The proposed approach reduces the cost of packet delivery and energy consumption using the well-known MapReduce framework with an intelligent selection of the reducers. Using MapReduce in the SDWSN by in-network processing significantly reduces energy consumption and balances traffic. Furthermore, the controller using an energy prediction model predicts the residual energy level of the nodes. Therefore, assuming the position of the nodes is fixed, the need to sequential send local packets is reduced. Reducing the number of local and energy information packets of the network decreases the network traffic. This consequently improves the quality of service and reduces energy consumption. Therefore, the proposed model increases the lifetime of the network. The results also confirm that the proposed E2-SDWSN significantly improves the energy throughput, the packet delivery ratio, and the delay through the sensor network.",none
ENERGY EFFICIENT ROBUST BACTERIAL FORAGING ROUTING PROTOCOL (EE-RBFRP) FOR BIG DATA NETWORK,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.procs.2022.12.078,0,research-article,ACM,2022,"Big data is a huge amount of heterogeneous information which keeps getting rapidly increased minute to minute. Volume is one of the most important features of big data and it is handled only in cloud computing which provides significant facility of on-demand availability. Routing plays vital role in accessing big data in cloud computing. If traditional protocols applied for routing the big data means it will never give its best performance in network and it will lead to increased reduced delivery of packets and increased delay. To overcome issue, this paper proposes an optimization-based routing protocol namely Energy Efficient Robust Bacterial Foraging Routing Protocol (EE-RBFRP) which is inspired from foraging behavior of bacteria. EE-RBFRP initially investigates the whole search space and performs local-search and global-search separately to exploit the promising regions of the network to find the best route to access the big data in cloud computing.

Distributed Data Storage Systems for Data Survivability in Wireless Sensor Networks using Decentralized Erasure Codes,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.comnet.2016.01.008,1,research-article,ACM,2016,"Achieving reliability in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is challenging due to the limited resources available. In this study, we investigate the design of data survivability schemes using decentralized storage systems in WSNs. We propose a data storage system design based on Decentralized Erasure Codes (DEC) that features a simple and decentralized construction of the target code. The proposed framework allows sensor nodes to cooperate to build an erasure code-based storage that can tolerate a given failure/erasure rate. Code construction and decoding can both be performed randomly allowing for a distributed operation with no prior setup or coordination between source nodes.

A secure localization scheme based on trust assessment for WSNs using blockchain technology,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.future.2021.06.039,4,research-article,ACM,2021,"Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is one of the integral part of the present ubiquitous and pervasive computing. The smartness of the applications is incomplete without WSNs. Almost all the scenarios of WSNs require efficient and accurate localization process. However, the main disadvantage of the existing frameworks and algorithms is that they are not so much significant with the trust of the beacon nodes which are integral part of WSNs. This must be ensured for localization. In our present solution, we consider this issue.It is obvious to have the malicious nodes in the hostile environment of WSN operations. Our proposed solution, therefore, address this challenge and provides a trust-based framework for secure localization. It focus on the trust assessment algorithm and blockchain generation. In the localization process, trust values of each beacon node are computed based on different trust metrics and the corresponding weights are dynamically adjusted. Subsequently, for the mining process, higher trusty beacon nodes are only selected. This two-step approach ensures an updated blockchain with reliability and consistent trust values of all beacon nodes. We perform a set of simulations to validate the performance and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The results are comparatively analyzed based on localization accuracy, detection of malicious activities, False Positive Rate (FPR), and False Negative Rate (FNR). In all the aspects our solution outperforms the other algorithms.Highlights•A trust evaluation-based localization algorithm is proposed based on blockchain technology.•A Proof-of-Stake consensus is introduced which enables the beacon node to add the trusted block.•Beacon nodes with the highest trust values are considered to perform the localization process.",none
CAIN: An energy-aware and intelligent increasing coverage area routing protocol for future 6G networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.comnet.2023.109733,0,research-article,ACM,2023,"More devices are being introduced to the cellular network every day, and it is time to think about how the next generation will deal with them. The 6G will bring new ways to think about how to share information and will not rely just on communication with a fixed Base Station (BS). A post-disaster scenario may damage the network infrastructure; the devices need to create an ad-hoc network to communicate in this situation. The ad-hoc network must achieve some of the 6G’s requirements, such as communication frequency, data rate, and latency, to communicate with the 6G networks when available. The increase in the frequency used to achieve such data rate has the downside of decreasing the signal range, i.e., for two nodes to communicate, they must be closer to each other. Academia is developing alternatives to increase the network coverage area, allowing devices to further the ad-hoc Access Point (AP) to overcome this drawback. Thus, with this work, we propose CAIN, an 6G routing protocol that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to increase the network coverage area. Depending on the node’s connectivity to an AP, i.e., if the node is connected to an AP or not, CAIN uses different messages to make nodes further the AP to communicate with it, increasing the network coverage area. Hence, if there is no connected node to an AP, it chooses a neighbor with a connection to one to forward the message. Also, if there is no connected neighbor to an AP, the node chooses a neighbor to flood the message until it reaches an AP. To improve its performance, we enhance CAIN with AI techniques, such as Reinforcement Learning (RL), Federated Learning (FL), and Deep Neural Network (DNN). These techniques allow the node to make a better neighbor choice and increase the network coverage area even more. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that proposes a routing protocol for the 6G scenario that uses RL techniques with FL and DNN to increase the network coverage. With these characteristics, CAIN makes devices further the APs to communicate with it using less energy and storage resources, producing less delay compared to other protocols.",none
Heterogeneous slot scheduling for real-time industrial wireless sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.comnet.2019.04.005,1,research-article,ACM,2019,"Real-time performance and reliability are two critical indicators in an industrial wireless sensor network (IWSN). Several time-division multiple-address (TDMA)-based industrial standards such as WirelessHART and ISA100 are widely used in IWSNs. However, to simplify the analysis, standard TDMA supports only one or two slot types in each frame, and each slot is usually 10 ms, which severely limits transmissibility and real-time responses in TDMA-based IWSNs where the number of transmissions is large but the length of most packets is small. In this paper, we propose a TDMA frame containing slots of different lengths to address this issue. The key ideas are to waste fewer slot resources and achieve on-demand slot allocation. First, we study the matching problem in a TDMA frame; then, we propose two scheduling methods, the split scheduling algorithm (SSA) and the double plug-in algorithm (DPA), under our TDMA frame. Extensive simulations and real testbed results show that the proposed solution DPA can significantly improve network performance and reliability. Real-time comparisons with other existing scheduling schemes show that the proposed solution improves the acceptance ratio by 48.8% compared to the rate-monotonic scheme.",none

Generally, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are the key paradigm that ensures Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Due to the limitation of energy sensor resources, the IoT-based WSN is an energy efficiency strategy. In this context, many strategies for energy conservation have been proposed in the literature. Due to the absence of a comparative study of these methods in the literature, the present paper proposes to study 60 recent energy-efficient methods dedicated to IoT applications based on WSNs. Paper selection is accomplished based on the best citation through the Web of Science, Scopus, and SCI indexed databases. First, the different approaches proposed in the literature are classified into three categories: routing methods, clustering methods, and miscellaneous methods. Routing methods are classified into seven types: multipath routing, distributed routing, centralized routing, survivable path routing, opportunistic routing, SDN- based routing, and QoS-based routing. Moreover, clustering approaches are organized into four types: fuzzy clustering, random clustering, weighted clustering, and hybrid clustering. For the Miscellaneous part, three phases are discussed: the physical layer, MAC layer, and security. Furthermore, a comparative study is performed concerning types, performance metrics, applications, simulators, and future research directions.

A guide for the selection of routing protocols in WBAN for healthcare applications,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1186/s13673-017-0105-6,6,article,ACM,2017,"In the present scenario, the term wireless body area network (WBAN) is becoming an integral part of human day to day life due its wide variety of applications, especially in the field of healthcare systems. To design such a reliable body area network system, there are a number of factors to be considered both in hardware and software levels. One of such factors still developing is the design and the analysis of routing protocols in the network layer. Routing protocols are a set of protocols which can identify and maintain the routes in the network so that the data can be exchanged between the nodes efficiently. Hence, routing protocol plays a vital role in the wireless sensor networks for reliable communication between the sensor nodes. In this paper, different routing protocols for body area networks are surveyed and observed that they are affected by factors like energy, network topology, various quality of services (QoS) in the nodes, node temperature, transmission range of nodes, human posture, etc. An evocative taxonomy of protocols is presented such as cluster-based, cross-layered, postural movement based, QoS aware and temperature-aware routing protocols. From the survey, it is found that the selection of a routing protocol is application dependent. For example, the energy efficient protocols like reinforcement learning based routing with QoS support or wireless autonomous spanning tree protocol can be used for daily health monitoring systems due to its high packet delivery ratio. If the system is for in vivo networks, routing algorithm for network of homogeneous and Id-less biomedical sensor nodes or mobility-supporting adaptive threshold-based Thermal-aware energy-efficient multi-hop protocols are the suitable ones. For critical and emergency cases, where accuracy with little delay is the major concern, the protocols like critical data routing, reliability aware routing, data-centric multi objective QoS-aware routing protocol, etc. can be rightly chosen.

This dynamic behaviour is either triggered by the deployed environment or by the user from outside. Because of their ability to monitor complex scenarios that change rapidly over time, wireless sensor networks are critical components of most advanced computing systems. These complex activities are influenced by different methods or even by the designers of their networks. Machine learning encourages many real solutions that optimise resource use and increase the network's lifespan in sensor networks. LEACH routing protocol has many limitations due to sudden energy utilisation & cluster head nodes due to direct communication with the base station node. This fast node energy leak creates several black hole structures in the networks, resulting in data redundancy, data packets transmission, node upgrade costs, and end-to-end delay for WSN. The proposed model with LEACH protocol functionality has improved network performance, network (WSN) efficiency, and solving data redundancy issues. By using an independent Recurrent Neural Network (IRNN)-based data fusion algorithm, namely, DFAIRNN.

The communication paradigm is changing and new approach related to machine learning or other optimization algorithms are being introduce rapidly. The TCP/IP or OSI model is not at all equipped to accommodate such a vast changes in its established protocol stacks. Considering this, we have proposed the hybrid cross layer design where the communication or transmission will be handle using two set of protocol stack. One set for the established classical network, and another using cross layer approach. Our design leverages the strengths of both the physical and MAC layers to optimize packet transmission and minimize energy consumption. An optimization algorithm based on gradient descent is also developed to adjust transmission parameters in real-time. The objective is to invoke the classical model only when it needed; it means until unless gradient descent is able to make classification regarding the node scheduling and achieve the acknowledgment, the TCP/IP protocol stack will be in deactivation. Using this method, we have performed our experiments mainly on two parameters named as packet delivery ratio (PDR), end-to-end delay (E2ED); because these are important aspect of reliability. In addition to that, the energy consumption of network is also compared with the existing algorithms. The results show that the proposed hybrid cross-layer design outperforms the existing algorithms. The performance gain can be attributed to the cross-layer approach and the use of the optimization algorithm. Overall, the proposed hybrid cross-layer design is a promising solution for reliable data transmission in wireless sensor networks, with the potential to improve network performance and prolong network lifetime by reducing energy consumption.",none

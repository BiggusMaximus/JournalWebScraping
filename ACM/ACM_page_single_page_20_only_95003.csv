Routing optimization meets Machine Intelligence: A perspective for the future network,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.neucom.2021.06.093,0,research-article,ACM,2021,"The future network is expected to support extremely large bandwidth, ultra-low latency or deterministic delay, extremely high reliability, and massive connectivity for novel forward-looking scenarios. As one of the most fundamental parts of the network, routing plays a vital role in a well-performed network. Recently, some new techniques using machine intelligence to optimize the network routing have been proposed. Although they have demonstrated great potential to improve the network performance, it is still a great challenge to apply machine intelligence-based routing in real network environment due to the limitations of current network architectures and protocols. Fortunately, the future network research program is on-going for designing new network paradigms, which provides an opportunity to address those limitations. In this paper, we investigate state-of-the-art techniques in machine intelligence-enabled network routing and discuss the development trends of machine intelligence-enabled routing optimization techniques for the future network.",none
Optimized scheme for cluster head selection and EAMPR routing protocol design in WSN,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.3233/JIFS-231342,0,research-article,ACM,2023,"Wireless sensor networks (WSN) is a popularly emerging technology with several opportunities to sustain in various field that require multipurpose sensor nodes, less energy and non-expensive system. But in the WSN, the radio transmission needs high amount of energy and this creates the critical problem. Hence consumption of energy has to be decreased to extend the network durability. Even though there are so many techniques existing for clustering approach of WSN, they have limitations like increased energy consumption, less delivery rate of data, redundancy and unbalanced network load. Hence, these problems are solved by introducing the energy efficient deep learning techniques for clustering and finding the optimal route. Initially the initialization process of system model is performed with the implementation of energy model. In WSN, energy consumption should be reduced to enhance the QoS and balance the network traffic. Hence clustering method is used to group up the sensor nodes and the optimal cluster head is selected with the proposed technique of hybrid cuckoo search and particle swarm optimization (CSO-PSO). As the CH is chosen, the optimal path of routing data should be found in addition with the procedure of optimization and it is done through the proposed model of Optimization based routing protocol that incorporates the Energy Aware Multi Point Routing (EAMPR) protocol along with the Improved Tuna Search Optimization (ITSO) algorithm. Finally, by the use of ITSO-EAMPR technique the energy consumption will get reduced with the decrease in relative mobility and high stability of nodes would be achieved. The simulations are proceeded and the outcomes are validated. The result obtained is compared with the traditional methods to show the effectiveness of proposed technique. As per the results obtained the proposed ITSO-EAMPR attains maximized PDR and Throughput, higher energy efficiency with extension in lifetime of WSN along with decrease in BER, end-to-end latency as compared to the existing techniques.",none

RA-MAC: A Relay Assisted MAC Protocol for Energy-efficient Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3366486.3366496,0,research-article,ACM,2020,"This paper presents the design and implementation of RA-MAC, an energy efficient protocol for Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSN).

Hybrid Deep Learning Approach for Improved Network Connectivity in Wireless Sensor Networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11277-022-10052-1,0,research-article,ACM,2022,"Wireless sensor networks occupy a prominent role in industrial as well as scientific applications. Lifetime enhancement and coverage are the major factors considered while designing the network. Various research models are evolved by considering the scheduling and routing process to solve the network lifetime issues. However, coverage and connectivity is another important factor that affects the lifetime of the remaining nodes. When a large number of sensors are deployed randomly, scheduling is preferred to enhance the network lifetime, but it leads to coverage issues. Other than scheduling, node damage, battery exhaustion, software and hardware failures might lead to coverage issues. Preserving the network connectivity while maximizing the network coverage is a crucial task in wireless sensor networks. To preserve the network connectivity and improve the wireless sensor networks coverage this research work presents a hybrid deep learning approach using a deep neural network and reinforcement learning algorithm.

Energy Efficiency Routing with Node Compromised Resistance in Wireless Sensor Networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11036-010-0287-x,4,article,ACM,2012,"For the energy limited wireless sensor networks, the critical problem is how to achieve the energy efficiency. Many attackers can consume the limited network energy, by the method of capturing some legal nodes then control them to start DoS and flooding attack, which is difficult to be detected by only the classic cryptography based techniques with common routing protocols in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). We argue that under the condition of attacking, existing routing schemes are low energy-efficient and vulnerable to inside attack due to their deterministic nature. To avoid the energy consumption caused by the inside attack initiated by the malicious nodes, this paper proposes a novel energy efficiency routing with node compromised resistance (EENC) based on Ant Colony Optimization. Under our design, each node computes the trust value of its 1-hop neighbors based on their multiple behavior attributes evaluation and builds a trust management by the trust value. By this way, sensor nodes act as router to achieve dynamic and adaptive routing, where the node can select much energy efficiency and faithful forwarding node from its neighbors according to their remaining energy and trust values in the next process of data collection. Simulation results indicate that the established routing can bypass most compromised nodes in the transmission path and EENC has high performance in energy efficiency, which can prolong the network lifetime.",none

QoS-oriented multimedia transmission using multipath routing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.future.2019.04.006,4,research-article,ACM,2019,"The multimedia sensor network application has very high requirements for the end-to-end transmission delay. Meanwhile, due to limitation of sensor node resources, the energy consumption also becomes one of main problems in restricting the application development. Providing the low delay transmission capability for the multimedia sensor network by multipath routing is the effective solution, but also leads to many problems such as multipath generation and flow management. For this purpose, this paper designs the QoS-oriented multipath multimedia transmission planning (Q-MMTP), sets up the multipath routing generation algorithm with energy-delay balance by defining the new model of multipath transmission on the basis of traditional spline path generation planning, and generates a series of ideal routing paths uniformly distributed in space by the specified number of paths, delay requirements and node transmission power.

While the smartphone mobile communications have greatly enhance user experiences, the conception of internet of things (IoT) which manages to achieve the broader network coverage of heterogeneous devices seems to be predictable. As an application based on internet and wireless communication techniques, the IoT might be promoted by the commercialization of present fifth generation (5G) mobile communication system. However, due to the considerable increase of information nodes, not limited to mobile phones, the direct networking strategy encounters energy consumption difficulties, which severely hinders the realization of IoT.

An energy-efficient data gathering algorithm to prolong lifetime of wireless sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.comcom.2009.11.008,17,article,ACM,2010,"Nodes in most wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are powered by batteries with limited energy. Prolonging network lifetime and saving energy are two critical issues for WSNs. Some energy-saving routing algorithms like minimum spanning tree based ones can reduce total energy consumption of a WSN, but they place too heavy burden of forwarding data packets on several key nodes so that these nodes quickly drain out available battery energy, making network lifetime shortened. In this paper, a routing algorithm termed Energy-efficient Routing Algorithm to Prolong Lifetime (ERAPL) is proposed, which is able to dramatically prolong network lifetime while efficiently expends energy. In the ERAPL, a data gathering sequence (DGS), used to avoid mutual transmission and loop transmission among nodes, is constructed, and each node proportionally transmits traffic to the links confined in the DGS. In addition, a mathematical programming model, in which minimal remaining energy of nodes and total energy consumption are included, is presented to optimize network lifetime. Moreover, genetic algorithms are used to find the optimal solution of the proposed programming problem. Further, simulation experiments are conducted to compare the ERAPL with some well-known routing algorithms and simulation results show the ERAPL outperforms them in terms of network lifetime.",none

Multi-objective Node Placement Considering Non-uniform Event Pattern,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11277-017-4834-7,1,article,ACM,2017,"Ease of use, high flexibility and variety of applications have made wireless sensor networks very popular. Node placement in a sensor network is very critical since it affects important network attributes such as coverage, lifetime, and reliability. Therefore, controlled node placement is necessary for achieving specific network features with minimum number of nodes. Since node placement is an NP-hard problem, many placement algorithms have been proposed based on heuristic and meta-heuristic methods. Most of those algorithms assume a uniform event pattern (UEP) throughout the area under investigation. However, in practice some networks deal with non-uniform event pattern (NEP). Optimization of one attribute of the network usually results in degradation of other attributes. That is why in recent studies multi-objective optimization methods have been used which usually provide a set of best answers while the final answer is selected by a decision maker applying a trade-off between all attributes. In this paper a method for controlled node placement is proposed based on multi-objective optimization (MOO) algorithms considering a non-uniform event pattern for the network (NPNEP). In that sense this method is an extension of the previous methods that use uniform event pattern. Because of the good performance of multi-objective optimization evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D), it is utilized as the optimization tool in node placement. In order to use MOEA/D, a few objective functions are defined which can optimize important attributes like coverage, power consumption, delay, reliability and lifetime. In order to achieve optimal node utilization, load balance, and increased lifetime, a cost function for routing is proposed as well as a data gathering and reporting method which both help increase the lifetime of a network. The proposed method can be used for wireless sensor networks with heterogeneous nodes. This algorithm can be used in initial deployment phase as well as operation phase or when problems like fragmentation or loss of coverage occurs. The result of NPNEP algorithm is the initial position of nodes or position of the new nodes which provide the best answers in MOO algorithm. Performance of the proposed algorithm and the effect of NEP as opposed to UEP have been verified by simulations.",none

This paper reviews the extent to which research in economic infrastructure sectors has engaged with fields of AI, to investigate the specific AI methods chosen and the purposes to which they have been applied both within and across sectors. Machine learning is found to dominate the research in this field, with methods such as artificial neural networks, support vector machines, and random forests among the most popular. The automated reasoning technique of fuzzy logic has also seen widespread use, due to its ability to incorporate uncertainties in input variables. Across the infrastructure sectors of energy, water and wastewater, transport, and telecommunications, the main purposes to which AI has been applied are network provision, forecasting, routing, maintenance and security, and network quality management. The data-driven nature of AI offers significant flexibility, and work has been conducted across a range of network sizes and at different temporal and geographic scales. However, there remains a lack of integration of planning and policy concerns, such as stakeholder engagement and quantitative feasibility assessment, and the majority of research focuses on a specific type of infrastructure, with an absence of work beyond individual economic sectors. To enable solutions to be implemented into real-world infrastructure systems, research will need to move away from a siloed perspective and adopt a more interdisciplinary perspective that considers the increasing interconnectedness of these systems.Highlights•Literature on the use of AI in infrastructure sectors is reviewed.•Types of AI, trends across sectors and purposes within infrastructure are identified.•Findings have been evaluated using an analysis framework.•The future of AI and the ‘Internet of Things’ in infrastructure are discussed.",none
An improvised optimization algorithm for submarine detection in underwater wireless sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s00542-023-05585-9,0,research-article,ACM,2024,"One of the most popular researches in recent years is UWSN (Underwater Sensor Network).

An adaptive trust system for misbehavior detection in wireless sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11276-024-03687-4,0,research-article,ACM,2024,"Trust management has been shown to be an effective technique for protecting networks from malicious nodes and ensuring wireless sensor network (WSN) security. A number of trust systems have been proposed, but most of them are not adaptative to the current state of network security and the intensity of the attacks to which they are subjected, especially in the case of collaborative attacks. They employ fixed trust metrics derived from expert opinion rather than the objective method based on the network’s current security level. Furthermore, they are complex trust systems designed for a specific application with a high attack probability. Thus, even with a low attack rate, they consume a lot of energy. This paper proposes an adaptive trust system that considers both the network’s risk level and the trust values of sensor nodes at the same time. To match the situation in the network, the proposed system employs various trust policies. In risky situations where the WSN environment remains untrustworthy, the proposed system adjusts its trust metrics based on the network attack intensity. When the attacks are eliminated and the misbehavior rate is low, the system switches to an energy efficient policy and adjusts its trust metrics to conserve sensor node energy. Simulation results show that a zero-tolerance policy achieves 95% of the detection rate and conserves 50% of nodes’ energy under the presence of 35% of malicious nodes in the network. Energy efficient policy achieves 90% of detection rate and conserves 95% of nodes’ energy under the existence of 10% of malicious nodes in the network. Normal policy achieves up to 90% of detection rate between 15 and 25% of malicious nodes while conserving 70% and 80% of energy under these percentages.",none
An efficient algorithm for scheduling sensor data collection through multi-path routing structures,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.jnca.2013.03.013,3,article,ACM,2014,"Multi-path routing is essential to improve the robustness of sensor data collection in error-prone wireless communication environments. Besides the robustness against communication failures, both the energy efficiency and time efficiency are also of primary importance in sensor data collection due to the limited energy supplies of sensor nodes and the real-time nature of sensor network applications. Contention-free time division multiple access (TDMA) protocols have the potential to reduce the energy consumption and the latency of sensor data collection. To collect sensor data using a TDMA protocol, sensor nodes need to be assigned appropriate time slots for transmitting and receiving data prior to the data collection process. We note that the distributed TDMA scheduling process for sensor data collection incurs overhead costs of energy consumption and time latency. However, these overhead costs are usually overlooked, especially when multi-path routing is used to collect sensor data. In this paper, we propose an efficient scheduling algorithm for data collection through multi-path routing structures in wireless sensor networks. The objective of our scheduling algorithm is to reduce both the message complexity and running time of the scheduling process as much as possible. In addition, we also develop a method for deriving a lower bound on the shortest possible length of the data collection schedule that can be generated by any algorithm. The lower bound latency estimation offers a practical method to evaluate the efficiency of data collection schedules produced by scheduling algorithms. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed scheduling algorithm significantly reduces the number of messages transmitted during the scheduling process and the running time compared to an existing scheduling algorithm. The length of the data collection schedule produced by our algorithm is normally within 1.9 times of the lower bound estimate across a wide range of network settings.",none

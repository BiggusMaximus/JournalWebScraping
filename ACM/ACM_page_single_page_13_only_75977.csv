QMR: Q-learning based Multi-objective optimization Routing protocol for Flying Ad Hoc Networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.comcom.2019.11.011,17,research-article,ACM,2020,"A network with reliable and rapid communication is critical for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Flying Ad Hoc Networks (FANETs) consisting of UAVs is a new paradigm of wireless communication. However, the highly dynamic topology of FANETs and limited energy of UAVs have brought great challenges to the routing design of FANETs. It is difficult for existing routing protocols for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) and Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) to adapt the high dynamics of FANETs. Moreover, few of existing routing protocols simultaneously meet the requirement of low delay and low energy consumption of FANETs. This paper proposes a novel Q-learning based Multi-objective optimization Routing protocol for FANETs to provide low-delay and low-energy service guarantees. Most of existing Q-learning based protocols use a fixed value for the Q-learning parameters. In contrast, Q-learning parameters can be adaptively adjusted in the proposed protocol to adapt to the high dynamics of FANETs. In addition, a new exploration and exploitation mechanism is also proposed to explore some undiscovered potential optimal routing path while exploiting the acquired knowledge. Instead of using past neighbor relationships, the proposed method re-estimates neighbor relationships in the routing decision process to select the more reliable next hop. Simulation results show that the proposed method can provide higher packet arrival ratio, lower delay and energy consumption than existing good performing Q-learning based routing method.",none
Localization algorithm in wireless sensor networks based on semi-supervised manifold learning and its application,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s10586-009-0118-7,4,article,ACM,2010,"Localization of mobile nodes in wireless sensor network gets more and more important, because many applications need to locate the source of incoming measurements as precise as possible. Many previous approaches to the location-estimation problem need know the theories and experiential signal propagation model and collect a large number of labeled samples. So, these approaches are coarse localization because of the inaccurate model, and to obtain such data requires great effort. In this paper, a semi-supervised manifold learning is used to estimate the locations of mobile nodes in a wireless sensor network. The algorithm is used to compute a subspace mapping function between the signal space and the physical space by using a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data. This mapping function can be used online to determine the location of mobile nodes in a sensor network based on the signals received. We use independent development nodes to setup the network in metallurgical industry environment, outdoor and indoor. Experimental results show that we can achieve a higher accuracy with much less calibration effort as compared with RADAR localization systems.",none

Considering the tradeoff between minimum video distortion and maximum network lifetime, a multi-objective cross-layer optimization framework is proposed, which not only optimizes network lifetime but also achieves optimal video quality, where the source encoding rate and link rate are jointly optimized. In addition, a secret scheme that couples secret sharing and multipath routing is developed to provide reliable security. Finally, a video distortion model, including source rate and link rate is specially studied. Decentralized algorithms are realized using a subgradient method to solve the multi-objective optimization problem. Experimental results demonstrate the optimal tradeoff performance. We also illustrated that the proposed scheme can achieve greater network lifetime and much less video distortion compared to existing distributed algorithms.",none

Data Congestion Control Using Offloading in IoT Network,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11277-022-09649-3,1,research-article,ACM,2022,"Internet of Things (IoT) is being used by a large number of applications and transmitting huge amounts of data.

Convergecast scheduling and cost optimization for industrial wireless sensor networks with multiple radio interfaces,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3287990.3288051,0,article,ACM,2018,"Industrial wireless sensor networks have been widely deployed in many industrial systems. The main communication paradigm of such systems, known as convergecast, is to converge sensing data to a centralized manager. The rapid and reliable data convergecast is essential to the industrial production. Multiple radio interfaces on a network device and convergecast scheduling algorithms can effectively reduce convergecast delay. Existing works confine to the convergecast based on linear- and tree-based routing. Compared to the two routing schemes, graph routing is more reliable. Although the graph routing gains more popularity in industrial networks due to its better reliability, few works have addressed its temporality performance. On the other hand, the number of radio interfaces also impacts on the convergecast delay. In this paper, we present a holistic framework to solve how to use multiple radio interfaces to converge data. First, we propose a convergecast scheduling algorithm for industrial wireless sensor networks with multiple radio interfaces. Second, based on our proposed scheduling algorithm, we propose an optimal algorithm and a fast heuristic algorithm to minimize the number of radio interfaces under the temporality constraint of industrial production.

On a vector space representation in genetic algorithms for sensor scheduling in wireless sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1162/EVCO_a_00112,3,article,ACM,2014,"Recent works raised the hypothesis that the assignment of a geometry to the decision variable space of a combinatorial problem could be useful both for providing meaningful descriptions of the fitness landscape and for supporting the systematic construction of evolutionary operators (the geometric operators) that make a consistent usage of the space geometric properties in the search for problem optima. This paper introduces some new geometric operators that constitute the realization of searches along the combinatorial space versions of the geometric entities descent directions and subspaces. The new geometric operators are stated in the specific context of the wireless sensor network dynamic coverage and connectivity problem (WSN-DCCP). A genetic algorithm (GA) is developed for the WSN-DCCP using the proposed operators, being compared with a formulation based on integer linear programming (ILP) which is solved with exact methods.

These problems open the door to attacks that could severely affect the performance of defense mechanisms. In this work, we use Markov Decision Processes as framework to model an attacker that is able to exploit these two problems. This allows us to model a defense mechanism theoretically and to obtain the performance of an attack against it, as well as to obtain the optimal attack against the defense mechanism - i.e., the attack that harms the most the defense mechanism. We also make use of Deep Reinforcement Learning tools, showing that they can be used by an intelligent attacker to successfully exploit a possibly unknown defense mechanism, providing a compromise between attack results and computational cost. We test our approach by thoroughly studying a Cooperative Spectrum Sensing attack, which we use to illustrate the framework proposed and to highlight their strengths and weaknesses.",none

It consists in finding an energy-efficient conflict-free (we will give later the definition of a conflict) schedule of minimum length for the transfer of aggregated data from all vertices of the lattice to the center node (base station).We find polynomially solvable cases, and also develop an efficient algorithm that builds a schedule with a guaranteed accuracy estimate. For example, when the transmission range is 2, the algorithm constructs either an optimal schedule or a schedule whose length exceeds the optimal latency by no more than 1. For a transmission range more than 2, an estimate of the reduction in the length of the schedule is obtained compared to the case when only one frequency is used.",none

TDMA scheduling algorithms for wireless sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11276-009-0183-0,50,article,ACM,2010,"Algorithms for scheduling TDMA transmissions in multi-hop networks usually determine the smallest length conflict-free assignment of slots in which each link or node is activated at least once. This is based on the assumption that there are many independent point-to-point flows in the network. In sensor networks however often data are transferred from the sensor nodes to a few central data collectors. The scheduling problem is therefore to determine the smallest length conflict-free assignment of slots during which the packets generated at each node reach their destination. The conflicting node transmissions are determined based on an interference graph, which may be different from connectivity graph due to the broadcast nature of wireless transmissions. We show that this problem is NP-complete. We first propose two centralized heuristic algorithms: one based on direct scheduling of the nodes or node-based scheduling, which is adapted from classical multi-hop scheduling algorithms for general ad hoc networks, and the other based on scheduling the levels in the routing tree before scheduling the nodes or level-based scheduling, which is a novel scheduling algorithm for many-to-one communication in sensor networks. The performance of these algorithms depends on the distribution of the nodes across the levels. We then propose a distributed algorithm based on the distributed coloring of the nodes, that increases the delay by a factor of 10---70 over centralized algorithms for 1000 nodes. We also obtain upper bound for these schedules as a function of the total number of packets generated in the network.",none

Correlation analysis and statistical characterization of heterogeneous sensor data in environmental sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.comnet.2019.106902,2,research-article,ACM,2019,"In wireless sensor networks, missing data is an inevitable phenomenon due to the inherent limitations of the sensor nodes, such as battery power constraints of nodes, missing communication links, bandwidth limitation, etc. Missing data adversely affects the quality of data received by the sink node. Since the data acquired by the sensor nodes in a multimodal environmental sensor network are spatially and temporally correlated, these correlations play a pivotal role in missing data recovery and data prediction. This paper proposes an analytical framework to characterize the correlation between two different pairs of modalities in an environmental sensor network using a set of classical and robust measures of correlation coefficient estimates. Monte Carlo simulation is performed to approximately model sensed environmental data characteristics. Three classical estimates (Pearson’s correlation coefficient, Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient, and Kendall’s-tau rank correlation coefficient), and four robust estimates of correlation coefficients are used to establish the correlation between different pairs of sensed modalities in the data characteristics. The efficacy of these estimates is obtained using the two performance metrics, mean-squared error (MSE) and relative estimation efficiency (RE). Stationarity analysis among the acquired environmental variables shed light upon the best estimates of the correlation coefficient, which could be used for prediction of temperature modality in a known region of slope/stationarity in the data characteristics. The robustness of the correlation coefficient estimates in the presence of outliers present in the data due to noise, errors, low residual battery power of sensor nodes, etc. is also investigated.",none
Toward Optimal Adaptive Online Shortest Path Routing With Acceleration Under Jamming Attack,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TNET.2019.2930464,3,research-article,ACM,2019,"We consider the online shortest path routing SPR of a network with stochastically time varying link states under potential adversarial attacks. Due to the denial of service DoS attacks, the distributions of link states could be stochastic benign or adversarial at different temporal and spatial locations. Without any a priori, designing an adaptive and optimal DoS-proof SPR protocol to thwart all possible adversarial attacks is a very challenging issue. In this paper, we present the first such integral solution based on the multi-armed bandit MAB theory, where jamming is the adversarial strategy. By introducing a novel control parameter into the exploration phase for each link, a martingale inequality is applied in our formulated combinatorial adversarial MAB framework. The proposed algorithm could automatically detect the specific jammed and un-jammed links within a unified framework. As a result, the adaptive online SPR strategies with near-optimal learning performance in all possible regimes are obtained.

One of the main challenges in designing WBANs is the routing problem, which is complicated due to dynamic changes in network topology and the limited resources of nodes. Several heuristic and metaheuristic methods have been presented to solve the routing problem in WBANs. Although metaheuristics outperform heuristics by producing higher-quality solutions, they cannot respond to real-time requests. This paper introduces a reactive routing protocol for WBANs that combines a fuzzy heuristic with a metaheuristic learning model. It utilizes a Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy Inference System in conjunction with the Grey Wolf Optimizer (named TSFIS-GWO). The objective is to simultaneously benefit from the advantages of both approaches, namely, the effectiveness of metaheuristics for offline hyperparameter tuning and the quickness of fuzzy heuristics for real-time routing. At every round, the tuned fuzzy system takes multiple parameters of the current state of the nodes and links to construct the multi-hop routing tree under IEEE 802.15.6. To optimize the performance of the protocol for each WBAN, the fuzzy rules of the TSFIS model are automatically adjusted through a learning method based on GWO. This is done in accordance with the specific requirements of the application, and the tuning process takes place once before the protocol is applied. Simulation results in three applications demonstrate that the proposed TSFIS-GWO model is capable of providing real-time solutions while outperforming the existing methods in terms of application-specific performance measures.Highlights•Introducing a hybrid heuristic-metaheuristic routing protocol for WBANs.•Presenting a heuristic Takagi-Sugeno FIS (TSFIS) for just-in-time routing.•Applying a metaheuristic-driven GWO for optimizing the TSFIS model.•Utilizing a tunable fitness function based on the application specifications.",none

In this work, we develop a mixed-integer linear programming model to maximize the network lifetime by optimally determining locations of sensors and sinks, activity schedules of deployed sensors, and sensor-to-sink data flow routes over a finite planning horizon subject to coverage, flow conservation, energy consumption, and budget constraints. Unfortunately, the exact solution of this model is difficult even for small problem instances.

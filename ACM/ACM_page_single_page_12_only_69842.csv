Multi-strategy enhanced grey wolf algorithm for obstacle-aware WSNs coverage optimization,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.adhoc.2023.103308,0,research-article,ACM,2024,"Moving sensor nodes can mitigate the coverage problem of random deployment in wireless sensor networks. However, the movement of nodes affects the lifetime and integrity of the network. Therefore, both energy saving and efficient coverage are crucial factors. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient coverage optimization technique with the help of the multi-Strategy grey wolf optimization (MSGWO) algorithm. This method can reduce energy consumption and improve coverage area by mixing higher-order multinomial sensing models and a sort-driven hybrid opposition-based learning. In addition, node movement and boundary strategies are proposed to help nodes jump out of obstacles when facing obstacle-aware deployments. The MSGWO is validated and compared on several classical test functions, and the results show that the MSGWO performs well. The MSGWO algorithm is applied to optimize the WSN coverage on different obstacle scenarios, the experimental results show that the algorithm helps to increase the network coverage from 84 % to 97.86 %, extends the network lifecycle by 50 %, reduces the cost of node deployment, and the network has good connectivity and scalability.",none

Clustering-based routing protocols are an energy-efficient protocols that improve the lifetime of a wireless sensor network. The objective of the clustering is to decrease the total transmission power by aggregating into a single path for prolonging the network lifetime. However, the problem of unbalanced energy consumption exists in some cluster nodes in the WSNs. In this paper, a hybrid algorithm is proposed for clustering and cluster head CH election.

Optimal Broadcast Scheduling Algorithm for a Multi-AUV Acoustic Communication Network,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TNET.2022.3232956,0,research-article,ACM,2023,"In systems of multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), to achieve cooperative operation and cluster intelligence, information is often disseminated via broadcasting.

QLEC: A Machine-Learning-Based Energy-Efficient Clustering Algorithm to Prolong Network Lifespan for IoT in High-Dimensional Space,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3337821.3337926,5,research-article,ACM,2019,"With the emergence of Internet of Things (IoT), many battery-operated sensors are deployed in different applications to collect, process, and analyze useful information.

Adaptive decision fusion with a guidance sensor in wireless sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1155/2015/643732,0,article,ACM,2015,"In wireless sensor networks, the fusion center collects the dates from the sensor nodes and makes the optimal decision fusion, while the optimal decision fusion rules need the performance parameters of each sensor node.

In order to accomplish this combinatorial optimisation rapidly, our approach prunes the search space using k-shortest path pruning and a graph reduction method that finds candidate routes promoting long minimum lifetimes. When arbitrarily many routes from a node to the base station are permitted, optimal routes may be found as the solution to a well-known linear program. We present an evolutionary algorithm that finds good routes when each node is allowed only a small number of paths to the base station. On a real network deployed in the Victoria & Albert Museum, London, these solutions, using only three paths per node, are able to achieve minimum lifetimes of over 99% of the optimum linear program solution's time to first sensor battery failure.",none

An Optimized and Energy-Efficient Ad-Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector Routing Protocol Based on Dynamic Forwarding Probability (AODVI),https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1155/2022/5750767,0,research-article,ACM,2022,"MANET (mobile ad-hoc network) is a wireless ad-hoc network made up of mobile devices that use peer-to-peer routing to provide network access instead of using a preexisting network infrastructure. Despite the network infrastructure’s simplicity, it faces issues such as changeable connection capacity, dynamic topology, node battery power exhaustion, and inadequate physical security. Broadcasting is a standard MANET approach for sending messages from a source node to all other nodes in the network. Flooding is a frequent method for broadcasting route request (RREQ) packets, which is susceptible to broadcast storms. The high retransmission rate is caused by the standard flooding technique, which causes media congestion and packet collisions, which can drastically reduce throughput and network performance. In a mobile ad-hoc network, efficient broadcasting focuses on selecting a compact forward node set while assuring broadcast coverage. The goal is to find a limited number of forward nodes that will provide complete coverage. In this paper, we propose an optimized and energy-efficient routing protocol for MANET (mobile ad-hoc network) based on dynamic forwarding probability in general and AODV (ad hoc on-demand distance vector) in particular, in which the route request packets are randomly controlled to increase the network lifetime and reduce packet loss in the flooding algorithm. We tested and assessed the results of our proposed solution using various network performance factors after implementing and integrating it into NS-2. According to simulation findings, our proposed technique effectively reduced route request propagation messages (RREQ). The suggested technique is more efficient, has a longer network lifetime, and uniformly utilizes node residual energy, enhancing network throughput and minimizing routing overhead when compared to regular and modified AODV protocols.",none

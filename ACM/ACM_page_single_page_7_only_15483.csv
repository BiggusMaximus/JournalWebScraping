Machine learning approaches for underwater sensor network parameter prediction,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.adhoc.2023.103139,0,research-article,ACM,2023,"Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks (UASNs) have recently attracted scientists due to its wide range of real-world applications. However, there are design challenges in UASNs, such as limited network lifetime and low communication reliability provoked by the constrained battery supply of sensors and harsh channel conditions in the underwater environments. To meet communication reliability requirements, packet-duplication and multi-path routing algorithms have been recommended in the literature. Furthermore, underwater sensors may convey sensitive data, which must be masked to avoid eavesdropping attempts. To improve network security, cryptographic encryption is the most widely used method. Nevertheless, data encryption needs computations to cipher the data, which consumes extra energy, resulting in a cutback in the life span of the network. To address these challenges, an optimization model has been proposed to evaluate the impacts of multi-path routing, packet duplication, encryption, and data fragmentation on the lifetime of the UASNs. However, the solution time of the proposed optimization model is quite high, and sometimes it cannot come up with feasible solutions. To this end, in this study, different regression and neural network methods have been proposed to predict network parameters and energy consumptions of underwater nodes as supplementary methods to optimization models. Performance evaluations show that the proposed methods yield remarkably accurate predictions and can be used for energy consumption prediction in UASNs.",none
Deep learning-based decision-making system for cooperative routing in wireless multimedia sensor network,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1504/ijnvo.2024.138491,0,research-article,ACM,2024,"This research aims to present a deep belief network (DBN) based a technique for choosing the most suitable cooperative nodes.

Towards modeling the behavior of physical intruders in a region monitored by a wireless sensor network,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1866423.1866425,1,research-article,ACM,2010,"A priority task for homeland security is the coverage of large spans of open border that cannot be continuously physically monitored for intrusion. Low-cost monitoring solutions based on wireless sensor networks have been identified as an effective means to perform perimeter monitoring. An ad-hoc wireless sensor network scattered near a border could be used to perform surveillance over a large area with relatively little human intervention. Determining the effectiveness of such an autonomous network in detecting and thwarting an intelligent intruder is a difficult task. We propose a model for an intelligent attacker that attempts to find a detection-free path in a region with sparse sensing coverage. In particular, we apply reinforcement learning (RL) - a machine learning approach - for our model. RL algorithms are well suited for scenarios in which specifying and finding an optimal solution is difficult. By using RL, our attacker can easily adapt to new scenarios by translating constraints into rewards. We compare our RL-based technique to a reasonable heuristic in simulation. Our results suggest that our RL-based attacker model is significantly more effective, and therefore more realistic, than the heuristic approach.",none

A digital twin-based energy-efficient wireless multimedia sensor network for waterbirds monitoring,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.future.2024.02.011,0,research-article,ACM,2024,"Wetlands play a critical role in maintaining the global climate, regulating the hydrological cycle, and protecting human health. However, they are rapidly disappearing due to human activities. Waterbirds are valuable bio-indicators of wetland health, but it is challenging to monitor them effectively. Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks (WMSNs) offer a promising technology for monitoring wetlands. Nonetheless, these networks are constrained in terms of energy, and also encounter challenges associated with large-scale deployments under natural environmental conditions. These conditions introduce harsh circumstances that may not have been anticipated during the pre-deployment testing phase. This paper proposes a Digital Twin (DT) based energy-efficient WMSN monitoring system specifically tailored for waterbirds in wetlands. The system utilizes a unique approach that combines local audio identification and image compression with DT technology to optimize network performance and minimize energy consumption. To reduce unnecessary image transmissions, the system employs a real-time, low-complexity local audio identification phase before triggering image capture. A denoising step is employed to achieve highly accurate bird recognition despite surrounding noises. Each image undergoes a low-complexity compression scheme prior to transmission, further enhancing energy efficiency. To enhance the system’s overall efficiency and effectiveness, DT technology is integrated to create real-time replicas of the WMSN and the monitoring application. A synergistic interaction between the two DTs enables cooperative data-making decision that ensures both QoS (Quality of Service) and QoE (Quality of Experience) requirements are met. Transmission rate control is done using a fuzzy logic decision-making technique. Real-time feedback provides rapid and accurate analysis of the current state of the WMSN, allowing for dynamic adjustments. The ”what-if scenarios” feature of the implemented DTs has been effectively leveraged to find the most suitable settings for the controller. The effectiveness and performance enhancements achieved by integrating DT into our WMSN-based surveillance system are validated through comprehensive experiments in scenarios that correspond to a real-world wetland. Comparative analyses demonstrate the undeniable benefits of the DT-integrated system compared to a conventional WMSN-based surveillance setup. In particular, the results demonstrate the system’s superior performance in terms of energy efficiency, real-time monitoring capabilities, and ability to handle multiple video sources.Highlights•Migratory waterbirds are a good indicator of the natural environment.•WMSN are proposed for continuous non-invasive monitoring of birds in their natural habitat.•Conventional WMSN lack optimized energy and struggle with unpredictable conditions in natural environments.•Audio identification prior to image capture is used to achieve significant energy savings.•Digital Twin is leveraged to enable real-time control and system optimization.",none
Heuristically accelerated reinforcement learning for channel assignment in wireless sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1504/ijsnet.2021.118877,0,research-article,ACM,2021,"In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), multi-channel communication represents an attractive field due to its advantage in improving throughput and delivery rate.

An adaptive learning scheme for load balancing with zone partition in multi-sink wireless sensor network,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.eswa.2012.02.119,10,research-article,ACM,2012,"Highlights We propose an adaptive learning scheme for load balancing scheme in multi-sink WSN. The mobile anchor adaptively partitions the network into several zones. The agent learns to balance the load in the way of reallocate the collection zones. The agent applies the residual energy of hotspots around sink nodes. The proposed QAZP scheme prolongs the lifetime of the wireless sensor network. In many researches on load balancing in multi-sink WSN, sensors usually choose the nearest sink as destination for sending data. However, in WSN, events often occur in specific area. If all sensors in this area all follow the nearest-sink strategy, sensors around nearest sink called hotspot will exhaust energy early. It means that this sink is isolated from network early and numbers of routing paths are broken. In this paper, we propose an adaptive learning scheme for load balancing scheme in multi-sink WSN. The agent in a centralized mobile anchor with directional antenna is introduced to adaptively partition the network into several zones according to the residual energy of hotspots around sink nodes. In addition, machine learning is applied to the mobile anchor to make it adaptable to any traffic pattern. Through interactions with the environment, the agent can discovery a near-optimal control policy for movement of mobile anchor. The policy can achieve minimization of residual energy's variance among sinks, which prevent the early isolation of sink and prolong the network lifetime.",none

Schedule-Based Cooperative Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning for Multi-channel Communication in Wireless Sensor Networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11277-021-09094-8,1,research-article,ACM,2022,"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have become an important component in the Internet of things (IoT) field. In WSNs, multi-channel protocols have been developed to overcome some limitations related to the throughput and delivery rate which have become necessary for many IoT applications that require sufficient bandwidth to transmit a large amount of data. However, the requirement of frequent negotiation for channel assignment in distributed multi-channel protocols incurs an extra-large communication overhead which results in a reduction of the network lifetime. To deal with this requirement in an energy-efficient way is a challenging task. Hence, the Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach for channel assignment is used to overcome this problem. Nevertheless, the use of the RL approach requires a number of iterations to obtain the best solution which in turn creates a communication overhead and time-wasting. In this paper, a Self-schedule based Cooperative multi-agent Reinforcement Learning for Channel Assignment (SCRL CA) approach is proposed to improve the network lifetime and performance. The proposal addresses both regular traffic scheduling and assignment of the available orthogonal channels in an energy-efficient way. We solve the cooperation between the RL agents problem by using the self-schedule method to accelerate the RL iterations, reduce the communication overhead and balance the energy consumption in the route selection process. Therefore, two algorithms are proposed, the first one is for the Static channel assignment (SSCRL CA) while the second one is for the Dynamic channel assignment (DSCRL CA).

According to the interaction with the surrounding environment, the transmitter parameters can be modified in the sensor nodes of CSN adaptively. In CSNs, routing is one of the important components. Based on the capability of spectrum-aware, the schemes of routing of CSNs are district from other networks. The changeable spectrum resource dynamically should be understood by the routing scheme to establish a path of reliable forwarding by the adjustment of routing policy adaptively. In CSNs, reliable routing is an essential thing but still not a well-explored problem in CSNs. Packet drops due to spectrum unavailability and buffer overflows seriously affects the connectivity of the nodes. The whole network’s lifetime and the data delivery rate are impacted by the prolonging packet drops. To increase the nodes’ lifetime, the addressing of this drawback in the phase of routing should be done. Before the making of routing decisions, a new routing technique is proposed named as Drop factor based energy efficient routing technique with the use of packet drop ratio and power dissipation metric of the spectrum links. With the total number of users in the routing path, the drop factor is computed. Power dissipation is calculated based on the transmitted data packets versus the amount of total consumed energy. This method reduces the drop ratio by avoiding the high drop factor nodes from being participating in the routing process. It always ensures that the data would be handled by the low dropping ratio nodes, thus the network’s lifetime is improved.

An ant-based QoS-aware routing protocol for heterogeneous wireless sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s00500-016-2347-z,8,article,ACM,2017,"Most of the existing routing protocols for wireless sensor networks consider homogeneous nodes wherein all sensor nodes have the same sensing, communication and computation capabilities. However, recent advances in multimedia technology have led to the availability of a wide range of sensors with widely varying capabilities. The introduction of multimedia sensors has presented additional challenges such as requirement of application-specific quality of service (QoS), high bandwidth and low delay. This paper presents an enhanced ant-based QoS-aware routing protocol for heterogeneous wireless sensor networks (EAQHSeN). It is a differentiated service-based QoS routing protocol for heterogeneous wireless sensor networks with multimedia and scalar nodes. We have used bio-inspired routing heuristics, and the key feature of the protocol is its ability to meet diverse QoS requirements claimed by heterogeneous traffic generated by the nodes. The routing decision is taken independently for control traffic, scalar traffic and multimedia traffic, thus maximizing the network performance and utilization. Simulation results show that the proposed EAQHSeN protocol performs better than the ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) routing protocol and energy-efficient ant-based routing (EEABR) protocol. The average percentage improvement in minimum residual energy by EAQHSeN over EEABR is approximately 4 % which is an indication of extended lifetime.",none
Secure Communication Using Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network and the Adaptive-Network-Based Fuzzy Inference System in Wireless Network,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s42979-023-02121-4,0,research-article,ACM,2023,"A Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) consists of many sensor nodes that collect data from various environmental conditions using the Internet of Things (IoT) and are often used to monitor and tune network environments. In this case, the presence of malicious nodes in the network leads to transmission security challenges, as it is believed to be a significant problem for successfully delivering captured data. Therefore, it is essential to protect network communication from security threats by detecting dangerous behavior for each sensor node and separating malicious nodes. This can be achieved by deploying an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) at the sensor nodes. However, limitations exist when dealing with high-dimensional data with complex underlying distributions. To tackle this issues, we introduce the Multi-layer Perceptron Neural Network (MLPNN) algorithm and the Adaptive-Network-Based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) algorithm for secure communication in WSN. Initially, we gathered a dataset called Darknet Internet Traffic from an online source. This dataset was organized using the Min–Max Scaling (MMS) technique. Afterwards, our proposed method identifies the network traffic using Traffic Intensive Cumulative Rate (TICR) method. Based on the network traffic, we analyze the transmission delay and optimal route using Trust factor Evaluation Rate (TFER). Next, it picks the best features of malicious activity using the ANFIS algorithm. Lately, our proposed MLPNN classifier with ReLU activation function has been used to categorize malicious activity and improve security in the network. Therefore, the proposed classifier's significant advantages in this paper include increased classification accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.",none

Underwater wireless sensor networks applications are exhilarating but demanding at the same time. Some of the challenges faced by underwater networks are the movement of nodes in three-dimensional space because of which the network could not be well thought-out as a fixed topology, limited bandwidth, exceedingly low data rates, limited battery power, failures due to pollution, and corrosion, and a lot more. Additionally, as acoustic communications consume more power than terrestrial radio ones do, more sophisticated signal processing methods are needed at the receiver to make up for the channel's deficiencies. One of these difficulties is creating a routing protocol for the complexity of an underwater environment. The major aim of all these protocols is to advance data packets toward the sink to lessen the propagation delay, lessen energy expenditure, and utilize the least amount of bandwidth by restricting the broadcasting of multiple copies of the data packet.

CPEH: A Clustering Protocol for the Energy Harvesting Wireless Sensor Networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1155/2021/5533374,0,research-article,ACM,2021,"In the last decade, energy harvesting wireless sensor network (EHWSN) has been well developed. By harvesting energy from the surrounding environment, sensors in EHWSN remove the energy constraint and have an unlimited lifetime in theory. The long-lasting character makes EHWSN suitable for Industry 4.0 applications that usually need sensors to monitor the machine state and detect errors continuously. Most wireless sensor network protocols have become inefficient in EHWSN due to neglecting the energy harvesting property. In this paper, we propose CPEH, which is a clustering protocol specially designed for the EHWSN. CPEH considers the diversity of the energy harvesting ability among sensors in both cluster formation and intercluster communication. It takes the node’s information such as local energy state, local density, and remote degree into account and uses fuzzy logic to conduct the cluster head selection and cluster size allocation. Meanwhile, the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) as a reinforcement learning strategy is utilized by CPEH to discover a highly efficient intercluster routing between cluster heads and the base station. Furthermore, to avoid cluster dormancy, CPEH introduces the Cluster Head Relay (CHR) strategy to allow the proper cluster member to undertake the cluster head that is energy depletion. We make a detailed simulation of CPEH with some famous clustering protocols under different network scenarios. The result shows that CPEH can effectively improve the network throughput and delivery ratio than others as well as successfully solve the cluster dormancy problem.",none

An Energy-Efficient and QoS-Preserving Hybrid Cross-Layer Protocol Design for Deep Learning-Based Air Quality Monitoring and Prediction,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s42979-023-02525-2,0,research-article,ACM,2024,"Cross-layer design countenances protocols belonging to diverse layers to collaborate and share network status information which ensures that contemporary route is optimal. Extremely reliable communication with least energy consumption can be achieved by adopting cross-layer protocol which is the main intention of this design. Due to its high reliability, cross-layer design is integrated with Internet of Things (IoT)-based real-time application for amplifying flexible layer techniques. However, amalgamation of inadequate layers and communication via interference affects the executing operations in environment. To overwhelm this, hybrid cross-layer protocol for air quality prediction (HCL-AQP) framework is proposed. Initially, the wireless sensor network (WSN) topology is constructed into dendrimer tree structure and then the sensor nodes are clustered by adaptive ball K-means clustering (AB-KC) algorithm for minimizing energy consumption thereby enhancing sensor coverage. After that, the sensor and UAV lifetime is ensured by performing two-level adaptive sleep scheduling using orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA). Besides, hybrid cross-layer protocol is designed for enhancing communication among several layers. Following that, parallel dual module deep Q-learning (PDMQL) and archerfish hunting optimization (AFHO) algorithm is adopted to implement congestion-aware routing thereby satisfying QoS. Furthermore, once the data are collected, the three stages of pre-processing is accomplished using outlier detection, batch normalization and dynamic interpolation using isolation forest (IF), cross-iteration batch normalization (CBN) and coarse-grained dynamic interpolation (CGDT), respectively. Finally, the significant features are extracted using prickling capsule network (PCapsNet) and air quality is predicted by attention based bi-directional long short-term memory (Att-BiLSTM) based on observed pollutants and meteorological data.

"A simple, lightweight, and precise algorithm to defend against replica node attacks in mobile wireless networks using neighboring information",https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.adhoc.2020.102081,0,research-article,ACM,2020,"Node replication attack (also known as replica attack) is one of the common attacks in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). In this attack, the adversary captures the sensor node(s) and extracts all important information, properties, and functions. Then, it disrupts the network operation by generating several malicious nodes having the same ID(s) as that of the captured node(s). Since the malicious nodes (i.e., replica nodes) have valid keying material, they can intentionally interfere with the network operation. Motivated by this, a three-step mechanism is proposed to detect replica nodes. The proposed mechanism benefits from watchdog nodes and is based on the idea that all nodes in the network (which are identified by their unique IDs) should have the same chance to be met by watchdog nodes. Accordingly, watchdog nodes monitor the network traffic and silently overhear the channel to see if there is any node with an abnormally higher chance of being met. If so, the ID of the node is advertised as the replica node.To evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanism in terms of probability of detecting replica nodes and false detection probability, a comprehensive set of simulations has been carried out using the J-SIM simulator. The simulation results reveal that the proposed mechanism detects almost all replica nodes while the false detection probability is below 0.005%. It outperforms state-of-the-art protocols with imposing ignorable processing and memory overhead.",none
Priority based energy and load aware routing algorithms for SDN enabled data center network,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.comnet.2023.110166,0,research-article,ACM,2024,"Nowadays, to accommodate the swift expansion of cloud computing, big data, and other emerging technologies, integrating data center networks and SDN (Software Defined Network) is suggested, which also improves the network management’s convenience and flexibility. As network devices in these data centers continue to increase at a high rate, efficient route management to handle these devices’ vast amounts of data has emerged as a significant concern. This work suggests a novel admission and routing scheme considering the importance or priorities of the network flows, path energy, and routing path load. Using the SDN paradigm in DCN (Data Center Network), we first develop a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation by jointly considering flow priority, path energy, and path load. The MILP formulation can maximize the number of flows as well as minimize the energy consumption and load variance in the network, or it can make a trade-off among all three. However, due to the potentially long running time, later, we introduce two greedy methods, Priority Based Energy Minimization Algorithm (PEMA) and Priority Based Evenly Load Distribution Algorithm (PEDL), where PEMA aims to maximize the flow with less energy, and PEDL focuses on maximizing the flow with reduced load variation. Finally, the developed routing strategies are implemented, and the simulation results demonstrate the out-performance of our work compared to the existing works in terms of successful flow ratio, energy savings, and load balancing.",none

Improved K-Means Based Q Learning Algorithm for Optimal Clustering and Node Balancing in WSN,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11277-021-09028-4,5,research-article,ACM,2022,"A wireless sensor network is a potential technique which is most suitable for continuous monitoring applications where the human intervention is not possible. It employs large number of sensor nodes, which will perform various operations like data gathering, transmission and forwarding. An optimal Q-learning based clustering and load balancing technique using improved K-Means algorithm is proposed. It contains two phases namely clustering phase and node balancing phase. The proposed algorithm uses Q-learning technique for deploying sensor nodes in appropriate clusters and cluster head CH election. In the clustering phase, the node will be placed in appropriate clusters based on the computation of the mean values. Once the sensors are placed in an appropriate cluster, then the cluster will be divided into ‘k’ partitions. The node which is having maximum residual energy in each partition will be elected as the partition head PH. In node balancing phase, the number of sensors in each partition will be evenly distributed by considering the area of the cluster and the number of sensors inside the cluster. Among the PHs, the node which is having residual energy to the maximum and also having the minimal distance to the sink is elected as the CH. The residual energy of the CH is monitored periodically. If it falls below the threshold level, then another partition head PH which is having residual energy to the maximum level and possessing minimum distance to the sink node will be elected as CH. The proposed Q-Learning based clustering technique maximize the reward by considering the throughput, end-to-end delay, packet delivery ratio and energy consumption.

Intertwined path formation and MAC scheduling for fast delivery of aggregated data in WSN,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.comnet.2014.10.018,1,research-article,ACM,2014,"This paper studies the problem of data aggregation scheduling in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to minimize time latency. In prior work on this problem, a node is assigned a parent from the set of unscheduled nodes in order to prevent the creation of cycles. However, using such a strategy reduces the time-slot reuse and consequently has a negative impact on the time latency. To address these shortcomings, we propose IPS (Interwined Path formation and MAC Scheduling), a novel cross-layer scheme for data aggregation scheduling that allows selecting a parent from all the node's neighbors including the scheduled ones. IPS achieves reduced data delivery latency through three key design features, namely, ( 1 ) intertwining aggregation tree formation and scheduling, ( 2 ) for each node, a parent can be selected from already scheduled nodes so that the time latency is reduced and the cycles are prevented and ( 3 ) applying parent selection criteria that maximize the time slot reuse.

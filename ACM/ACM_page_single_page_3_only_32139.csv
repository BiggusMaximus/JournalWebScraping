Intelligent routing algorithm for wireless sensor networks dynamically guided by distributed neural networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.comcom.2023.05.018,1,research-article,ACM,2023,"Using reinforcement learning to adjust the power balance of sensor nodes dynamically is an essential approach for extending the lifetime of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), which makes sensor nodes adapt to changing environments by calculating optimal decision solutions in real time. However, as WSN grows, error propagation cannot keep up with topological changes in the networks, which prevents the sensor nodes’ routing decisions from being timely optimized. In this paper, we propose the DNN-HR algorithm, which optimizes the reinforcement learning process of WSN in three ways. First, this paper constructs a two-level learning structure. Discrete nodes perform reinforcement learning during the interaction with their neighboring nodes. Simultaneously, the neural networks that fit the V values guide the underlying nodes’ learning. Second, the algorithm divides the sensor networks into two-level subspaces according to their geographic locations, and cluster heads are elected in each subspace to form weight incremental propagation trees. Third, each sensor node sends the weight increments it learned to its first-level cluster head. At the first-level cluster head, the weight increments sent by multiple nodes are received and accumulated, and then the results are sent to the second-level cluster head. The base station acquires the weight increments of all the second-level cluster heads and then broadcasts the updated neural network weights to all the WSN nodes. Experiments determine the appropriate heuristic parameters. Compared to other algorithms, the experiments show that our proposed scheme significantly improves the packet delivery rate, node survival rate, and energy standard deviation of nodes.",none

Performance evaluation of wireless sensor network MAC protocols with early sleep problem,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1504/ijcnds.2020.108875,1,research-article,ACM,2020,"Energy efficiency and increased throughput are the two major goals in the design of MAC protocols in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The traditional sensor-MAC (S-MAC) and timeout-MAC (T-MAC) protocols have been proposed to achieve these dual desirable goals by proper scheduling of duty cycles. Although these protocols have been proved to excel the performance when compared with their predecessor protocols for MANETs, the idea of duty cycling, if not tuned carefully may not work well in some linear chain topologies.

Energy-aware scheduling for information fusion in wireless sensor network surveillance,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.inffus.2018.08.005,3,research-article,ACM,2019,"ts•We propose an intelligent wake-up scheme for information fusion in wireless sensor network surveillance.•We propose a node importance based information fusion scheme.•We conduct extensive experiments to verify the proposed method.AbstractEffective energy control while maintaining reliable monitoring performance becomes a key issue in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) based surveillance applications. While importance difference of surveillance zone, limited energy and dynamic network topology pose great challenges to surveillance performance. It is necessary to adjust sensor nodes' awakening frequency dynamically for information fusion. Thus an energy-aware scheduling with quality guarantee method named ESQG is proposed in this paper which considers sensor nodes' residual energy, different importance degrees of the surveillance zone and network topology comprehensively. It first uses a Voronoi diagram to determine the effective scope of each sensor node and then calculates node importance according to its residual energy and the importance degree of the effective scope. Then ESQG utilizes the importance of individual sensing scope and current forwarding costs to further compute node importance and awakening frequency for information fusion. In this way, ESQG can dynamically adapts each nodes awakening frequency to its dynamic network topology and importance degree of each individual sensing scope. The nodes are then turned on stochasticlly via the node awakening probability and node importance based information fusion is conducted for target detection. Besides, an adaptive process of perception factor C is proposed to match actual situation, and automatically change according to the detected data. Experiments results demonstrate that the proposed method ESQG can reduce the number of awakening nodes to a large extent while maintaining high reliability via information fusion.",none

Dynamic Multi-hop Clustering in a Wireless Sensor Network: Performance Improvement,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11277-017-4023-8,15,article,ACM,2017,"A cluster-based model is preferable in wireless sensor network due to its ability to reduce energy consumption. However, managing the nodes inside the cluster in a dynamic environment is an open challenge. Selecting the cluster heads (CHs) is a cumbersome process that greatly affects the network performance. Although there are several studies that propose CH selection methods, most of them are not appropriate for a dynamic clustering environment.

However, these algorithms work better within a single-hop clustering model framework, and the network lifetime constitutes a big issue in case of multi-hop clustering environments. This paper introduces a new CH selection method based on GA for both single-hop and the multi-hop cluster models. The proposed method is designed to meet the requirements of dynamic environments by electing the CH based on six main features, namely, (1) the remaining energy, (2) the consumed energy, (3) the number of nearby neighbors, (4) the energy aware distance, (5) the node vulnerability, and (6) the degree of mobility.

Routing Algorithm for Energy Efficiency Optimizing of Wireless Sensor Networks based on Genetic Algorithms,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11277-023-10849-8,0,research-article,ACM,2024,"With the popularization of wireless sensor networks (WSN) and the concept of IoT (Internet-of-things), several applications have emerged in the industrial, scientific and engineering sectors. However, energy consumption is a challenge, because the demands for improvement in transmission rates and latency limitations. In particular, increasing the lifetime of wireless sensor networks has been a common goal in recent research. A viable alternative to solve this problem consists in reducing the data traffic defined by the routing protocol, which optimizes the number of messages that travel through the network. These protocols can also be optimized using evolutive algorithms, such as genetic algorithms. In the present work, is proposed a routing algorithm for WSN based on genetic algorithms, with the purpose of minimizing the total distance from the sensor node to the sink, which would allow optimized use of energy by sensor nodes and extend the lifetime of the WSN. The proposed algorithm includes a form of chromosome coding that had not yet been used in the context of routing and a new multi-objective fitness function. Performance analyzes were carried out establishing exhaustive search (ES) and opportunistic routing (OR) algorithms as comparison references and considering two scenarios: an open field and the other in a closed residential area. Proposed algorithm revealed superior performance when compared to reference algorithms. In open space and in the residential scenario, the lifetime provided by the proposed algorithm was 7320 and transmissions greater than that provided by OR. It was also observed that, with the increase in the number of transmissions, the standard deviation of the nodes’ residual energy is smaller when GAEA-RP is applied, which means the predictability of the energy consumed by them. After 1.8×105 transmissions, it was 0.105 J for GAEA-RP versus 0.188 J for OR in the first scenario. In the second scenario, in addition to the smaller standard deviation of the residual energy, the proposed algorithm provides an average energy very close to that obtained with OR, which indicates the possibility of its application in environments with more obstacles.

Handling Coexistence of LoRa with Other Networks through Embedded Reinforcement Learning,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3576842.3582383,2,research-article,ACM,2023,"The rapid growth of various Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) technologies in the limited spectrum brings forth the challenge of their coexistence. Today, LPWANs are not equipped to handle this impending challenge. It is difficult to employ sophisticated media access control protocol for low-power nodes. Coexistence handling for WiFi or traditional short-range wireless network will not work for LPWANs. Due to long range, their nodes can be subject to an unprecedented number of hidden nodes, requiring highly energy-efficient techniques to handle such coexistence. In this paper, we address the coexistence problem for LoRa, a leading LPWAN technology. To improve the performance of a LoRa network under coexistence with many independent networks, we propose the design of a novel embedded learning agent based on a lightweight reinforcement learning at LoRa nodes. This is done by developing a Q-learning framework while ensuring minimal memory and computation overhead at LoRa nodes. The framework exploits transmission acknowledgments as feedback from the network based on what a node makes transmission decisions. To our knowledge, this is the first Q-learning approach for handling coexistence of low-power networks. Considering various coexistence scenarios of a LoRa network, we evaluate our approach through experiments indoors and outdoors. The outdoor results show that our Q-learning approach on average achieves an improvement of 46% in packet reception rate while reducing energy consumption by 66% in a LoRa network. In indoor experiments, we have observed some coexistence scenarios where a current LoRa network loses all the packets while our approach enables 99% packet reception rate with up to 90% improvement in energy consumption.",none
Reinforcement learning based reliability-aware routing in IoT networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.adhoc.2022.102869,0,research-article,ACM,2022,"The unprecedented scale and ubiquity of the Internet of Things (IoT) introduce a maintainability challenge. IoT networks operate in diverse and harsh environments that impose thermal stress on IoT devices. The lifetime of these networks can be limited by hardware failures resulting from exacerbated reliability degradation mechanisms at high temperatures. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive and distributed reliability-aware routing protocol based on reinforcement learning to mitigate the reliability degradation of IoT devices and improve the network Mean Time to Failure (MTTF). Through routing, we curb the utilization of quickly degrading devices, which helps to lower the device power dissipation and temperature, thus reducing the effect of temperature-driven failure mechanisms. To quantify and optimize networking performance besides reliability, we incorporate Expected Transmission Count (ETX) in our formulations as a measure of communication link quality. Our proposed algorithm adapts routing decisions based on the current reliability status of the devices, the amount of degradation they are likely to experience due to communication activity, and network performance goals. We extend the ns-3 network simulator to support our reliability models and evaluate the routing performance by comparing with state-of-the-art approaches.

Dynamic link utilization empowered by reinforcement learning for adaptive storage allocation in MANET,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s00500-023-09281-8,0,research-article,ACM,2023,"In modern wireless networks, mobile nodes often deal with the challenge of maintaining a sufficient number of data packets due to limited storage capacity within each cluster. It adversely impacts network performance by compromising data quality during transmissions. The ensuing delays, caused by data packets awaiting storage allocation, result in reduced throughput and increased end-to-end latency. To effectively address these issues, we present a Dynamic Link Utilization with Reinforcement Learning (DLU-RL) method, which is designed to optimize storage allocation for communication data packets, significantly enhancing network performance. Instead of static allocation, DLU-RL employs dynamic strategies guided by reinforcement learning algorithms. This innovative method not only tackles storage constraints but also proactively adapts to varying network conditions and traffic patterns. In our approach, we first perform a comprehensive analysis of storage capacities across all nodes, establishing a baseline for dynamic resource allocation. The DLU-RL framework then swiftly assigns storage space based on real-time demand and priority, optimizing storage utilization on the fly. As a result of implementing DLU-RL, substantial enhancements in throughput and concurrent minimization of end-to-end delays are achieved. This research not only contributes to efficient storage allocation techniques but also pioneers the integration of reinforcement learning for wireless communication network performance optimization.

Multi-user reinforcement learning based task migration in mobile edge computing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11704-023-1346-3,1,research-article,ACM,2023,"Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is a promising approach. Dynamic service migration is a key technology in MEC.

Node position estimation based on optimal clustering and detection of coverage hole in wireless sensor networks using hybrid deep reinforcement learning,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11227-023-05494-8,0,research-article,ACM,2023,"Sensor nodes, typically small and low-power devices, are components of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Each node monitors its surroundings for relevant environmental changes and sends all detected events to the data collector for analysis. If the sensor nodes are not placed correctly, there may be areas that are not within the detection zone of any sensor node.

Intermediate sensor nodes decide about the next receiving node of the report using a lightweight optimization process based on the network’s mean residual energy, sensors’ distance to BS, and the positions of neighboring sensors. Evaluations show that the proposed algorithm directs traffic toward the boundaries of the network, which leads to better balance in traffic and energy consumption network-wide.

Sleep scheduling integrated with CDG can further promote energy efficiency. Most of existing sleep scheduling methods for CDG were formulated as centralized optimization problems which introduced many extra control message exchanges. Meanwhile, a few distributed methods usually adopted stochastic decision which could not adapt to variance in residual energy of nodes. A part of nodes were prone to prematurely run out of energy. In this paper, a reinforcement learning-based sleep scheduling algorithm for CDG (RLSSA-CDG) is proposed. Active nodes selection is modeled as a finite Markov decision process. The mode-free Q learning algorithm is used to search optimal decision strategies. Residual energy of nodes and sampling uniformity are considered into the reward function of the Q learning algorithm for load balance of energy consumption and accurate data reconstruction. It is a distributed algorithm that avoids large amounts of control message exchanges. Each node takes part in one step of the decision process.

Use of a dedicated positioning device incurs additional cost and reduces battery life; therefore, a range-free localization scheme is promising as a cost-effective approach. However, the main limitation of this approach is that the estimation precision can be affected by factors such as node density, sensing coverage, and topology diversity. Thus, this study investigates and proposes a method for improving a traditional range-free-based localization method (centroid) that uses soft computing approaches in a hybrid model. This model integrates a fuzzy logic system into centroid and uses an extreme learning machine (ELM) optimization technique to capitalize on the strengths of both approaches: the former is properly used with low node density and short coverage, while the latter is used for the opposite—to achieve a robust location estimation scheme. The ratios of known nodes within the sensing coverage range to the total known nodes and of the sensing coverage range to the maximum coverage range are used as adaptive weights for this hybrid model. To further improve the efficiency, especially in heterogeneous topologies, the concept of resultant force vectors is applied to this hybrid model over particle swarm optimization to mitigate the effects of irregular deployments. The performance of the proposed method is extensively evaluated via simulations that demonstrate its effectiveness compared to other state-of-the-art soft-computing-based range-free localization schemes (i.e., centroid, a fuzzy logic system, and a support vector machine with a traditional ELM).",none

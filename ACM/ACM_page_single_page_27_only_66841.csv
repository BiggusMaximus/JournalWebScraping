Learning-Based spectrum selection in cognitive radio ad hoc networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/978-3-642-13315-2_11,1,Article,ACM,2010,"Cognitive Radio Ad Hoc Networks (CRAHNs) must identify the best operational characteristics based on the local spectrum availability, reachability with other nodes, choice of spectrum, while maintaining an acceptable end-to-end performance. The distributed nature of the operation forces each node to act autonomously, and yet has a goal of optimizing the overall network performance. These unique characteristics of CRAHNs make reinforcement learning (RL) techniques an attractive choice as a tool for protocol design. In this paper, we survey the state-of-the-art in the existing RL schemes that can be applied to CRAHNs, and propose modifications from the viewpoint of routing, and link layer spectrum-aware operations. We provide a framework of applying RL techniques for joint power and spectrum allocation as an example of Q-learning. Finally, through simulation study, we demonstrate the benefits of using RL schemes in dynamic spectrum conditions.",none

SECURE and energy-efficient routing protocol based on micro-segmentation and batch authentication,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.comnet.2024.110293,0,research-article,ACM,2024,"An effective technique in designing routing algorithms for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is named clustering nodes, which augments the network lifespan. More tasks are performed by the Cluster Heads (CHs) of the clustered WSNs, thereby consuming more energy. Hence, a secure energy-efficient Routing Protocol (RP) centered on micro-segmentation and batch authentication is proposed here. The proposed method begins by initializing the WSN nodes. After that, a random key is engendered for every node centered on their Node ID. The nodes undergo a Micro-segmentation process; in addition, they are securely grouped utilizing the Supremum Distance based K-Prototype (SD-KP) algorithm. Now, a fog layer with a number of fog nodes is initialized; also, every single micro-segmented group is assigned with an optimal fog node. Then, by using the Quasi Deterministic Sequence-Black Widow Optimization (QDS-BWO) algorithm, the optimal fog nodes are selected. By using the Root Squared- Diffie Hellman (R2-DH) technique, a key agreement is created for each group centered on their Node IDs. By using the Bitwise Cyclic Shift –BLAKE 512 (BCS-BLAKE-512) algorithm, the created keys are converted into hashcode. Now, for the purpose of performing batch authentication, the hashcode of each group is sent to the trusted authority. Subsequent to verification, data sensing occurs.

Dynamic mobile charger scheduling with partial charging strategy for WSNs using deep-Q-networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s00521-021-06146-9,6,research-article,ACM,2021,"Wireless sensor networks are a group of spatially distributed nodes deployed to sense, gather, and transmit data to the sink for further analytics. Due to continuous operations, the battery-equipped sensor nodes (SNs) drain energy rapidly, and replacing them is a hectic task. Wireless energy transfer (WET) is evolved as a promising innovation to recharge the SNs battery wirelessly to address the challenges. A WET is embedded in a vehicle called a mobile charger (MC) and traveled in the network to recharge the SNs. However, scheduling the mobile charger over the network before a sensor node dies is challenging. In this work, we introduced a partial charging strategy to avoid the long waiting time for MC because full recharging of a single node takes a long time. The partial charging strategy preempts the current charging node and moves to the newly requested node to minimize the network’s dead nodes. However, it will increase the traveling distance. Hence, adequate charging time and MC traveling path are required. In this context, this paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning-based mobile charger scheduling strategy called dynamic partial mobile charger scheduling using deep-Q-networks (DPMCS). The proposed DPMCS learns from the environment and decides each sensor’s charging duration in an identified tour. Experimental results reveal that the proposed DPMCS outperforms well compared to the existing studies, enhance the lifetime and diminish the dead nodes count.",none
A new unequal clustering protocol with local re-clustering mechanism for wireless sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1504/IJCSE.2016.076935,2,article,ACM,2016,"A new unequal clustering protocol with local re-clustering mechanism is proposed to mitigate the 'hot spot' problem and thereby prolong the network lifetime of a wireless sensor network WSN. In the setup phase, the network is partitioned into several unequal-size layers based on the minimum hop count of each node to the base station BS. Then each layer is further partitioned into several layer-dependent-size clusters by a weight-based cluster head CH competition, where candidate nodes participating in CH election are selected by the BS with a new exploration approach. In addition, we propose a local re-clustering mechanism to further mitigate the uneven energy load during the data transmission phase, that is, different layers reselect their CHs at different frequencies according to their relative distances to the BS. Furthermore, for local re-clustering, a simplified CH rotation approach is proposed to lessen the communication and computation overhead.

A time-efficient convergecast scheduling on star-linear IWSN for narrow process industries,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1155/2015/123062,0,article,ACM,2015,"The wireless technology is regarded as a paradigm shifter in the process industry. A star-linear industry wireless sensor network (IWSN) for narrow process industries is proposed in this paper. Based on the proposed IWSN, we focus on time-efficient convergecast solutions.

Reformed timeslot allocation for data intensive clustered industrial wireless sensor networks using virtual grid structure with UWB,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1504/ijaip.2021.116359,0,research-article,ACM,2021,"The data intensive industrial sensor networks produce excessive communication collision and introduce significant deficits. Further, a defined, appropriate scheduling methodology for transmission is desirable for mitigating the scarcity of such networks. With this declaration, here inclined a method for allocating conflict-free timeslots for transmitting the data in clustered sensor networks securing it from collision. This is lightened by partitioning the monitoring cluster regions into equal sized virtual grids and Latin square characteristics support scheduling in individual grids on ultra-wide band. This decentralised protocol follows an AODV routing and thereby each sensor is aware of the neighbouring nodes location and accepts the inherent topology changes. Moreover, the nodes that are participating in transmission remains in active state and the others become idle, thus conserving less energy.

CMML: Combined metaheuristic-machine learning for adaptable routing in clustered wireless sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.asoc.2022.108477,2,research-article,ACM,2022,"Cluster-based routing is the most common routing approach to achieve energy efficiency in wireless sensor networks. However, optimal determination of cluster heads is NP-hard, which calls for heuristics or metaheuristics for obtaining a near-optimal solution. Although metaheuristics achieve better performance, they suffer from high computational time, and thus, cannot rapidly respond to routing requests. Also, a large majority of the existing routing protocols cannot easily adapt to changing network or application configurations. In this paper, a Combined model based on Metaheuristics and Machine Learning, named CMML, is proposed to support efficient and adaptable routing in clustered wireless sensor networks. In our CMML model, a multi-criteria heuristic clustering algorithm is used for clustering in which a metaheuristic (e.g., genetic algorithm) is utilized for the automatic tuning of the heuristic algorithm for each configuration separately. We repeat this process for several configurations (i.e., for different network sizes, numbers of nodes, aggregation factors, lifetime definitions, etc.). The tuned heuristic algorithm in each configuration is subsequently used for network simulation to obtain the corresponding solution. As a result, a comprehensive dataset for different configurations is derived, which is used to train a machine learning model (e.g., support vector machine). The input feature vector of a sample comprises local features (current state of a node at a round), global features (current state of the network), and application-specific features, while the output is the priority factor of each node to be selected as a cluster head. After training the CMML model, it can be applied as a quickly adaptable clustering protocol. In fact, our motivation is to utilize the generalizability of machine learning to learn the behavioral pattern of the metaheuristic algorithm in finding best routes for previous configurations. Simulation results demonstrate that the CMML model can effectively adapt with different applications, while prolonging the network lifetime based on the application requirements.Highlights•A combined metaheuristic-machine learning technique (named CMML) is presented.•The CMML considers local features, global features, and application features.•The objective function of the metaheuristic algorithm is defined based on the application specifications.•The CMML is evaluated on the test WSNs to justify the performance of the trained CMML model.•The trained CMML model can be applied for online clustering in new unseen WSNs.",none

Fuzzy cluster-based multi-node charging strategy in mobile sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.adhoc.2024.103439,0,research-article,ACM,2024,"Energy is crucial for the continuous operation of rechargeable sensor networks, and efficient energy replenishment strategies are vital for improving network performance. However, existing solutions primarily focus on stationary sensor networks, and there are fewer strategies for energy replenishment in mobile networks. Typically, a Mobile Car (MC) charges individual mobile nodes one to one.

Firstly, an improved multi-factor fuzzy C-mean clustering algorithm (MFCM++) is designed to cluster nodes with similar moving directions and remaining energy. Secondly, the cuckoo search algorithm (CS) is utilized to determine the optimal charging position for each cluster based on the varying energy demand levels of mobile nodes, thereby reducing the cluster charging waiting time. Finally, a spatio-temporal factor-based cluster selection algorithm (STCS) is developed to determine the order of cluster charging and select the next cluster to be charged.

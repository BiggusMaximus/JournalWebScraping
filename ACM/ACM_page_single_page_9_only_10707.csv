Reinforcement learning-based real time search algorithm for routing optimisation in wireless sensor networks using fuzzy link cost estimation,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1504/ijcnds.2019.099967,1,research-article,ACM,2019,"Internet of things is a technological advancement of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) which are characterised by highly complex, large scale, heterogeneous, dynamically changing and asymmetric networks. Such constraints make routing in WSNs a difficult task. This paper introduces fuzzy link cost estimation-based real time search routing algorithm (fuzzy RTS) in which link cost estimation is obtained from physical and MAC layer parameters like residual energy, packet drop rate and RSSI.

RLS2: An energy efficient reinforcement learning- based sleep scheduling for energy harvesting WBANs,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.comnet.2023.109781,1,research-article,ACM,2023,"In the Energy-Harvesting Wireless Body Area Networks (EH-WBAN), one of the fundamental challenges is preserving the self-sustainability of sensors without compromising network reliability and connectivity. Determining the sleep/wake schedule of body nodes (BNs) is an efficient way to achieve self-sustainability. Sleeping nodes should be connected to at least one active node to reduce delay and keep the network connected. There are two fundamental problems with previous methods for determining BN's sleep/wake schedule: (1) BN suffers from emergency packet loss and unnecessary frequent sleeping and waking up, and (2) They do not guarantee network connectivity. Studies that have only examined connectivity in EH-WBAN also have two main issues: (1) BNs are considered homogenous in terms of energy harvesting and its consumption, (2) These methods cannot adapt to the time-varying behavior of energy-harvesting resources. This study proposes a new method for sleep/wake scheduling called Reinforcement Learning-based Sleep Scheduling (RLS2). RLS2 has the following innovative points: (1) To avoid emergency packet loss or unnecessary frequent sleeping and waking up, each BN has its own sleep/wake schedule based on its energy level and sensed data changes, (2) Lowest possible number of BNs are determined as relay nodes in each round to increase network reliability and connectivity; these BNs remain active in each round, while the others operate according to the determined schedule. In this part of the proposed method: (1) Heterogeneous BNs are considered, (2) As a first step in solving adaptability, the problem of finding the optimal active groups is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP), followed by a Q-learning algorithm capable of learning time-varying behavior of energy harvesting resources, (3) The unavailable action space is removed to reduce the problem's complexity, (4) To achieve good Q-learning performance, a reward function based on residual energy level and neighborhood degree of BNs is defined. It can find an active group with the lowest cardinality in the current round, which is maximum in terms of the residual energy of its sensors. The performed simulations indicate the appropriate convergence of the proposed method. The results show that, on average, the proposed method improves network connectivity and energy efficiency by 50% and 31%, respectively, and reduces network delay by 27%.Graphical abstractDisplay Omitted",none
Exploiting relay nodes for maximizing wireless underground sensor network lifetime,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s10489-020-01735-y,2,research-article,ACM,2020,"A major challenge in wireless underground sensor networks is the signal attenuation originated from multi-environment transmission between underground sensor nodes and the above-ground base station. To overcome this issue, an efficient approach is deploying a set of relay nodes aboveground, thereby reducing transmission loss by shortening transmitting distance. However, this introduces several new challenges, including load balancing and transmission loss minimization. This paper tackles the problem of deploying relay nodes to reduce transmission loss under a load balancing constraint by proposing two approximation algorithms. The first algorithm is inspired by Beam Search, combined with a new selection scheme based on Boltzmann distribution. The second algorithm aims to further improve the solutions obtained by the former by reducing the transmission loss. We observe that we can find an optimal assignment between sensor nodes and a set of the chosen relay in polynomial time by reformulating the part of the problem as a bipartite matching problem with minimum cost. Experimental results indicate that the proposed methods perform better than the other existing ones in most of our test instances while reducing the execution time.",none
TDMA policy to optimize resource utilization in Wireless Sensor Networks using reinforcement learning for ambient environment,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.comcom.2022.08.013,0,research-article,ACM,2022,"Data packet reaches from the end node to sink in a multihop fashion in the internet of things (IoTs) and sensor networks. Usually, a head node (among neighboring or special purpose nodes) can collect data packets from the nodes and forward them further to sink or other head nodes. In Time-division multiple access (TDMA) driven scheduling, nodes often own slots in a time frame and are scheduled for data forwarding in the allotted time slot (owner node) in each time frame. A time frame in which the owner node does not have data to forward goes into sleep mode. Though the supposed owner node is in sleep mode, the corresponding head node is active throughout the time frame. This active period of a head node can cause an increase in energy consumption. Besides, because the head node in an active state does not receive a data packet, it is causing significantly to the throughput, ultimately leading to low channel utilization. We propose the Markov design policy (MDP) for such head nodes to reduce the number of time slots wasted in the time frame in our work. The proposal is the first such kind of MDP-based modeling for node scheduling in TDMA. The simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms existing adaptive scheduling algorithms for channel utilization, end-to-end delay, system utilization, and balance factor.",none
Event Driven Duty Cycling with Reinforcement Learning and Monte Carlo Technique for Wireless Network,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1155/2021/6644389,0,research-article,ACM,2021,"Reducing transmission delay and maximizing the network lifetime are important issues for wireless sensor networks (WSN). The existing approaches commonly let the nodes periodically sleep to minimize energy consumption, which adversely increases packet forwarding latency.

However, the selection of cluster heads and routes is NP-hard. Most of the existing routing protocols use heuristic or metaheuristic optimization algorithms to solve this problem. Most protocols regard the selection of the cluster head and routing as two independent problems. However, the selection of cluster heads will affect the selection of routes, and there is a certain relationship between the two stages. Therefore, considering these two problems independently, the solution obtained is not necessarily the optimal solution in the network. In addition, most of the existing routing protocols are still subject to conventional clustering and conventional multi-hop communication in the network, which is extremely unfavorable for reducing the energy consumption of nodes.

Enhanced WSN Routing Protocol for Internet of Things to Process Multimedia Big Data,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11277-021-08760-1,0,research-article,ACM,2022,"Due to the massive use of wireless Internet of Things (IoT), the advent of multimedia-big-data in recent decades poses numerous obstacles for successful contact with the virtual era. Mobile Adhoc Network-based IoT (MANET IoT) framework is increasingly common in this regard owing to its increased communication protocols and economic efficiency. MANET comprises arbitrary, battery-driven, roaming nodes that do not have architecture that can handle the traffic and control the IoT network.

Enhancing network lifespan in wireless sensor networks using deep learning based Graph Neural Network,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.phycom.2023.102076,1,research-article,ACM,2023,"Inadequate energy of sensors is one of the most significant challenges in the development of a reliable wireless sensor network (WSN) that can withstand the demands of growing WSN applications. Implementing a sleep-wake scheduling scheme while assigning data collection and sensing chores to a dominant group of awake sensors while all other nodes are in a sleep state seems to be a potential way for preserving the energy of these sensor nodes. When the starting energy of the nodes changes from one node to another, this issue becomes more difficult to solve. The notion of a dominant set-in graph has been used in a variety of situations. The search for the smallest dominant set in a big graph might be time-consuming. Specifically, we address two issues: first, identifying the smallest possible dominant set, and second, extending the network lifespan by saving the energy of the sensors. To overcome the first problem, we design and develop a deep learning-based Graph Neural Network (DL-GNN). The GNN training method and back-propagation approach were used to train a GNN consisting of three networks such as transition network, bias network, and output network, to determine the minimal dominant set in the created graph. As a second step, we proposed a hybrid fixed-variant search (HFVS) method that considers minimal dominant sets as input and improves overall network lifespan by swapping nodes of minimal dominating sets. We prepared simulated networks with various network configurations and modeled different WSNs as undirected graphs. To get better convergence, the different values of state vector dimensions of the input vectors are investigated. When the state vector dimension is 3 or 4, minimum dominant set is recognized with high accuracy.

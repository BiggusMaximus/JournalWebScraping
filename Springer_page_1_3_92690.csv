Routing in Wireless Sensor Networks Using Optimization Techniques: A Survey,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11277-019-06993-9,74,Article,Springer,2020,"Over the past few decades, one of the important advancements in wireless communication is low cost and limited power devices known as wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Sensor nodes are used to transmit data but have limited amount of energy. As the transmission takes place, energy gets depleted. So energy consumption and network lifetime are the major challenges in a WSN. Much research has been done in the past years to determine an optimal path between source and destination nodes, which will result in maximizing energy conservation of a network. However, the challenge is to create a routing algorithm that takes into consideration the major issues of minimizing energy consumption and maximizing network lifetime. Various optimization techniques are available to determine a routing path between a source node and destination node. In this article, we look into the details of routing in WSN using different optimization techniques. This article provides us a comprehensive summary of the previous studies in field of WSN during the span of 2010–2019. The results provided in this article provide the future insight for researchers to fill in existing gaps in the WSN research field and to find new research trends in this area.","Optimization techniques,Routing in WSN,Wireless sensor network (WSN)"
Optimizing IoT-enabled WSN routing strategies using whale optimization-driven multi-criterion correlation approach employs the reinforcement learning agent,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11082-023-06269-4,none,Article,Springer,2024,"Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are rapidly integrating into various fields due to their sensing capabilities, making them ideal for connecting multiple users to the Internet of Things (IoT) for real-time applications. However, these networks face limitations in delay and energy, impacting the efficiency of routing protocols. For devices to operate effectively over extended periods, optimizing these protocols is crucial. Addressing this, our study introduces a machine learning-optimized routing protocol tailored for IoT-enabled WSNs. This protocol efficiently manages IoT devices, emphasizing energy efficiency and mobility. We present the Whale Optimization-Driven Multi-Criterion Correlation (WOD-MCC) method, which consistently updates routing strategies based on insights from energy consumption and traffic patterns, ensuring effective routing decisions. This method evaluates device energy levels and node access to reduce data congestion and energy consumption while preserving the connectivity of IoT devices. For the performance evaluation of the proposed WOD-MCC, energy efficiency, scalability, and network connectivity are emphasized. In terms of data delivery, energy conservation, and delay reduction, our findings indicate that the WOD-MCC method outperforms existing protocols.","IoT-enabled WSNs,Data transmission,Reinforcement learning,Whale optimization-driven multi-criterion correlation,Cluster-based routing strategies"
A distributed reinforcement learning based sensor node scheduling algorithm for coverage and connectivity maintenance in wireless sensor network,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11276-020-02350-y,43,Article,Springer,2020,"The fundamental challenge for randomly deployed resource-constrained wireless sensor network is to enhance the network lifetime without compromising its performance metrics such as coverage rate and network connectivity. One way is to schedule the activities of sensor nodes and form scheduling rounds autonomously in such a way that each spatial point is covered by at least one sensor node and there must be at least one communication path from the sensor nodes to base station. This autonomous activity scheduling of the sensor nodes can be efficiently done with Reinforcement Learning (RL), a technique of machine learning because it does not require prior environment modeling. In this paper, a Nash Q-Learning based node scheduling algorithm for coverage and connectivity maintenance (CCM-RL) is proposed where each node autonomously learns its optimal action (active/hibernate/sleep/customize the sensing range) to maximize the coverage rate and maintain network connectivity. The learning algorithm resides inside each sensor node. The main objective of this algorithm is to enable the sensor nodes to learn their optimal action so that the total number of activated nodes in each scheduling round becomes minimum and preserves the criteria of coverage rate and network connectivity. The comparison of CCM-RL protocol with other protocols proves its accuracy and reliability. The simulative comparison shows that CCM-RL performs better in terms of an average number of active sensor nodes in one scheduling round, coverage rate, and energy consumption.","Coverage redundancy,Coverage rate,Network connectivity,Reinforcement learning,Nash Q-learning,Node activity scheduling"
An intelligent fault detection approach based on reinforcement learning system in wireless sensor network,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11227-021-04001-1,33,Article,Springer,2022,"The Internet of Things (IoT) has developed a well-defined infrastructure due to commercializing novel technologies. IoT networks enable smart devices to compile environmental information and transmit it to demanding users through an IoT gateway. The explosive increase of IoT users and sensors causes network bottlenecks, leading to significant energy depletion in IoT devices. The wireless network is a robust, empirically significant, and IoT layer based on progressive characteristics. The development of energy-efficient routing protocols for learning purposes is critical due to environmental volatility, unpredictability, and randomness in the wireless network’s weight distribution. To achieve this critical need, learning-based routing systems are emerging as potential candidates due to their high degree of flexibility and accuracy. However, routing becomes more challenging in dynamic IoT networks due to the time-varying characteristics of link connections and access status. Hence, modern learning-based routing systems must be capable of adapting in real-time to network changes. This research presents an intelligent fault detection, energy-efficient, quality-of-service routing technique based on reinforcement learning to find the optimum route with the least amount of end-to-end latency. However, the cluster head selection is dependent on residual energy from the cluster nodes that reduce the entire network’s existence. Consequently, it extends the network’s lifetime, overcomes the data transmission’s energy usage, and improves network robustness. The experimental results indicate that network efficiency has been successfully enhanced by fault-tolerance strategies that include highly trusted computing capabilities, thus decreasing the risk of network failure.","Energy efficient,Fault tolerant,Wireless sensor networks,Internet of things,Cluster head,Reinforcement learning"
"Underwater wireless sensor networks: a review of routing protocols, taxonomy, and future directions",https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11227-023-05646-w,3,Article,Springer,2024,"Wireless transmission of information using water as a communication channel is one of the potential technologies for the progress of potential underwater observation systems including applications from aquaculture to the oil industry, submarine detection, instrument monitoring, and forecast of natural turbulence and study of marine life. Underwater wireless sensor networks applications are exhilarating but demanding at the same time. Some of the challenges faced by underwater networks are the movement of nodes in three-dimensional space because of which the network could not be well thought-out as a fixed topology, limited bandwidth, exceedingly low data rates, limited battery power, failures due to pollution, and corrosion, and a lot more. Additionally, as acoustic communications consume more power than terrestrial radio ones do, more sophisticated signal processing methods are needed at the receiver to make up for the channel's deficiencies. One of these difficulties is creating a routing protocol for the complexity of an underwater environment. The major aim of all these protocols is to advance data packets toward the sink to lessen the propagation delay, lessen energy expenditure, and utilize the least amount of bandwidth by restricting the broadcasting of multiple copies of the data packet. This article surveys various routing schemes and various challenges involved in the design and development of these routing schemes.","Clustering,Energy efficiency,Routing,Underwater sensor networks,Void holes"

A Tabu search based routing algorithm for wireless sensor networks,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11276-015-1060-7,20,Article,Springer,2016,"In this paper, a Tabu search based routing algorithm is proposed to efficiently determine an optimal path from a source to a destination in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). There have been several methods proposed for routing algorithms in wireless sensor networks. In this paper, the Tabu search method is exploited for routing in WSNs from a new point of view. In this algorithm (TSRA), a new move and neighborhood search method is designed to integrate energy consumption and hop counts into routing choice. The proposed algorithm is compared with some of the ant colony optimization based routing algorithms, such as traditional ant colony algorithm, ant colony optimization-based location-aware routing for wireless sensor networks, and energy and path aware ant colony algorithm for routing of wireless sensor networks, in term of routing cost, energy consumption and network lifetime. Simulation results, for various random generated networks, demonstrate that the TSRA, obtains more balanced transmission among the node, reduces the energy consumption and cost of the routing, and extends the network lifetime.","Wireless sensor networks (WSNs),Routing,Ant colony optimization (ACO),Tabu search (TS),Energy consumption,Network lifetime"
Multi-objective intelligent clustering routing schema for internet of things enabled wireless sensor networks using deep reinforcement learning,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10586-023-04218-0,2,Article,Springer,2024,"The Internet of Things (IoTIoT) is built on a foundation of wireless sensor devices that connect humans and physical objects to the Internet and enable them to interact with one another to improve the living conditions of citizens. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are widely utilized in systems based on IoT to collect the data required by intelligent environments. However, IoT−enabled WSNs encounter a variety of difficulties such as poor network lifespan, limited throughput, and long communication delays, due to the massive non-homogenous data streaming from numerous sensor devices. Therefore, a multi-objective intelligent clustering routing schema for IoT−enabled WSNs utilizing deep reinforcement learning is proposed in this paper to overcome these shortcomings. The proposed schema partitions the entire network into various unequal clusters based on the present data load existing in sensor nodes, effectively preventing the network from dying prematurely. In addition, an unequal clustering mechanism is utilized to balance inter-cluster and intra-cluster energy consumption among cluster heads. The simulation findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schema in terms of energy efficiency, delivered packets, end-to-end delay, alive nodes, energy balancing, and network lifespan compared with the other two state-of-the-art existing schemes.","Deep reinforcement learning (DRL),Multi-objective,Wireless sensor networks (WSNs),Intelligent routing,Internet of things (IoT)"

An intelligent fault detection approach based on reinforcement learning system in wireless sensor network,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11227-021-04001-1,33,Article,Wiley,2022,"The Internet of Things (IoT) has developed a well-defined infrastructure due to commercializing novel technologies. IoT networks enable smart devices to compile environmental information and transmit it to demanding users through an IoT gateway. The explosive increase of IoT users and sensors causes network bottlenecks, leading to significant energy depletion in IoT devices. The wireless network is a robust, empirically significant, and IoT layer based on progressive characteristics. The development of energy-efficient routing protocols for learning purposes is critical due to environmental volatility, unpredictability, and randomness in the wireless network’s weight distribution. To achieve this critical need, learning-based routing systems are emerging as potential candidates due to their high degree of flexibility and accuracy. However, routing becomes more challenging in dynamic IoT networks due to the time-varying characteristics of link connections and access status. Hence, modern learning-based routing systems must be capable of adapting in real-time to network changes. This research presents an intelligent fault detection, energy-efficient, quality-of-service routing technique based on reinforcement learning to find the optimum route with the least amount of end-to-end latency. However, the cluster head selection is dependent on residual energy from the cluster nodes that reduce the entire network’s existence. Consequently, it extends the network’s lifetime, overcomes the data transmission’s energy usage, and improves network robustness. The experimental results indicate that network efficiency has been successfully enhanced by fault-tolerance strategies that include highly trusted computing capabilities, thus decreasing the risk of network failure.",none

Energy-balanced routing in wireless sensor networks with reinforcement learning using greedy action chains,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00500-023-08734-4,1Citation,Article,Wiley,2023,"The challenge of routing in energy-constrained wireless sensor networks is to balance energy and extend network lifetime, and reinforcement learning is an effective method to address this problem. However, poor learning and decision-making efficiency are still the main factors affecting the network routing performance. In this research, RLR-TET is proposed as a reinforcement learning approach that evaluates the shortest routing and achieves node energy balance. First, this study employs a method in which each node broadcasts control information directly to its neighbor nodes, allowing learning to be accomplished by simple communication. Second, multiple greedy action chains form a tree structure by learning to build a greedy action chain. Third, the tree is dynamically adjusted during the learning process. Toward the root, each sensor node can obtain its optimal next hop; toward the leaf, each sensor node can achieve the update of the learning errors. Fourth, the learning errors of V-values are backpropagated along the tree to multi-layer nodes using the eligibility traces approach, achieving fast multi-step updates. In our experiments, we compared the method of this paper with five other algorithms.

Routing Algorithm for Energy Efficiency Optimizing of Wireless Sensor Networks based on Genetic Algorithms,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11277-023-10849-8,none,Article,Wiley,2023,"With the popularization of wireless sensor networks (WSN) and the concept of IoT (Internet-of-things), several applications have emerged in the industrial, scientific and engineering sectors. However, energy consumption is a challenge, because the demands for improvement in transmission rates and latency limitations. In particular, increasing the lifetime of wireless sensor networks has been a common goal in recent research. A viable alternative to solve this problem consists in reducing the data traffic defined by the routing protocol, which optimizes the number of messages that travel through the network. These protocols can also be optimized using evolutive algorithms, such as genetic algorithms. In the present work, is proposed a routing algorithm for WSN based on genetic algorithms, with the purpose of minimizing the total distance from the sensor node to the sink, which would allow optimized use of energy by sensor nodes and extend the lifetime of the WSN. The proposed algorithm includes a form of chromosome coding that had not yet been used in the context of routing and a new multi-objective fitness function. Performance analyzes were carried out establishing exhaustive search (ES) and opportunistic routing (OR) algorithms as comparison references and considering two scenarios: an open field and the other in a closed residential area. Proposed algorithm revealed superior performance when compared to reference algorithms. In open space and in the residential scenario, the lifetime provided by the proposed algorithm was 7320 and transmissions greater than that provided by OR. It was also observed that, with the increase in the number of transmissions, the standard deviation of the nodes’ residual energy is smaller when GAEA-RP is applied, which means the predictability of the energy consumed by them. After \(1.8 \times 10^{5}\) transmissions, it was 0.105 J for GAEA-RP versus 0.188 J for OR in the first scenario. In the second scenario, in addition to the smaller standard deviation of the residual energy, the proposed algorithm provides an average energy very close to that obtained with OR, which indicates the possibility of its application in environments with more obstacles. Concisely, the work introduces a new way of performing routing in WSN with average residual energy similar to OR, but with a slightly larger lifespan and greater residual energy uniformity between nodes.",none
Particle-Water Wave Optimization for Secure Routing in Wireless Sensor Network Using Cluster Head Selection,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11277-021-08335-0,33,Article,Wiley,2021,"Wireless sensor network (WSN) has some great advantages, such as flexible communication, low power consumption, and low cost. In view of the WSN clustering algorithm, the dynamic cluster head selection methods are put forward in order to solve the problem of the unreasonable cluster head selection that may lead to the overlapping coverage and unbalanced energy consumption in the cluster communication. Also, security is an important aspect in the WSN. Various security and routing protocols are developed for increasing the efficiency of packet transmission, but discovering the optimal path without degrading transmission reliability poses a challenging task in the sensor network. Hence, an effective and optimal secure routing algorithm named Particle-Water Wave Optimization (P-WWO) is developed in this research for routing the data packets in secure path. The proposed P-WWO algorithm is designed by integrating the Particle Swam Optimization (PSO) with the Water Wave Optimization (WWO). The secure route needed to broadcast the data packets is determined through the selection of Cluster Head using the PSO-based cellular automata with fitness measure. However, the fitness measure is computed by considering the factors, like energy, delay, trust, consistency factor, and maintainability factor. Accordingly, the routing path with the minimal distance and less delay is accepted as the optimal path using the proposed P-WWO based on the fitness value. The route maintenance process enables the proposed optimization to decide whether the packets can be transmitted in the selected route or need to re-route the data. Moreover, the proposed P-WWO obtained better performance using the metrics, such as energy balancing index, coverage, number of alive-nodes, and average energy left with the values of 0.9246 99.9%, 144, and 0.666 J, respectively.",none

Betweenness centrality based connectivity aware routing algorithm for prolonging network lifetime in wireless sensor networks,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11276-015-1054-5,13,Article,Wiley,2016,"
Network lifetime is the key design parameter for wireless sensor network protocols.

These methods have mainly considered residual energy, number of hops and communication cost as route selection metrics. This paper introduces a method for further improvement in the network lifetime by considering network connectivity along with energy efficiency for the selection of data transmission routes. The network lifetime is enhanced by preserving highly connected nodes at initial rounds of data communication to ensure network connectivity during later rounds. Bassed on the above mentioned concept, a connectivity aware routing algorithm: CARA has been proposed. In the proposed algorithm, connectivity factor of a node is calculated on the basis of Betweenness centrality of a node and energy efficient routes are found by using fuzzy logic and ant colony optimization.

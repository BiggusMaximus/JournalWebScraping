Internet of things multi hop energy efficient cluster-based routing using particle swarm optimization,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11276-021-02801-0,0,research-article,ACM,2021,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is a collection of various sensors connected to the internet that share information. In a large-scale IoT network, data is collected through the wireless sensor network (WSN), and the aggregated data is sent from the sink to the next level of IoT for processing. Clustering is utilized to cut down on energy use, network redundancy, interference, and collision in WSN and improve network lifetime, scalability, and data aggregation. In addition, multi-hop communication is more effective for networks with sensors that cover a broad region. The Multi-Hop Low Energy Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy brings about a reduction to the transmission distance and prolongs the network lifetime. This particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique is effective for determining the most effective solutions for a particular problem. The particles in the PSO embody the candidate solutions tend to move through their solutions space (in several directions) in different velocities. A distributed multi-hop cluster-based routing algorithm that takes advantage of the PSO and the Lightening Search Algorithm is developed in this work. The proposed method optimizes the clustering process and achieves energy efficiency, as demonstrated by the experimental results.

BANSIM: A new discrete-event simulator for wireless body area networks with deep reinforcement learning in Python,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.sysarc.2022.102489,1,research-article,ACM,2022,"Many studies have investigated machine learning algorithms to improve the performance of wireless body area networks (WBANs). However, it was difficult to evaluate algorithms in a network simulator because of missing interfaces between the simulators and machine learning libraries. To solve the problem of compatibility, some researchers have attempted to interconnect existing network simulators and artificial intelligence (AI) frameworks. For example, ns3-gym is a simple interface between ns-3 (in C++) and the AI model (in Python) based on message queues and sockets. However, the most essential part is the implementation of an integrated event scheduler, which is left to the user. In this study, we aim to develop a new integrated event scheduler. We present BANSIM, a discrete-event network simulator for WBAN in standard Python that supports deep reinforcement learning (DRL). BANSIM provides an intuitive and simple DRL development environment with basic packet communication and BAN-specific components, such as the human mobility model and on-body channel model. Using BANSIM, users can easily build a WBAN environment, design a DRL-based protocol, and evaluate its performance. We experimentally demonstrated that BANSIM captured a wide range of interactions that occurred in the network. Finally, we verified the completeness and applicability of BANSIM by comparing it with an existing network simulator.",none,

Exact and Approximation Algorithms for Data Mule Scheduling in a Sensor Network,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/978-3-319-28472-9_5,0,Article,ACM,2015,"We consider the fundamental problem of scheduling data mules for managing a wireless sensor network. A data mule tours around a sensor network and can help with network maintenance such as data collection and battery recharging/replacement. We assume that each sensor has a fixed data generation rate and a capacity upper bound on storage size. If the data mule arrives after the storage capacity is met, additional data generated is lost. In this paper we formulate several fundamental problems for the best schedule of single or multiple data mules and provide algorithms with provable performance. First, we consider using a single data mule to collect data from sensors, and we aim to maximize the data collection rate. We then generalize this model to consider k data mules. Additionally, we study the problem of minimizing the number of data mules such that it is possible for them to collect all data, without loss. For the above problems, when we assume that the capacities of all sensors are the same, we provide exact algorithms for special cases and constant-factor approximation algorithms for more general cases. We also show that several of these problems are NP-hard. When we allow sensor capacities to differ, we have a constant-factor approximation for each of the aforementioned problems when the ratio of the maximum capacity to the minimum capacity is constant.",none,

An Energy-Aware Hybrid Approach for Wireless Sensor Networks Using Re-clustering-Based Multi-hop Routing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11277-021-08614-w,9,research-article,ACM,2021,"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) consist of a large number of sensor nodes, which are primarily employed for collecting data from an environment of interest. Energy resources of WSN nodes are generally restricted, irreplaceable and non-rechargeable. Hence, lowering the level of energy consumption in such networks to save more energy is the key issue in the literature. Clustering, selecting the best Cluster Head (CH) among candidates, and performing the routing only among cluster heads would be an effective approach to reduce the WSN nodes energy consumption. Therefore, cluster-based routing leads to extending the network’s lifetime through aggregating data in CHs, uniformly distributing the energy among nodes, and, consequently, reducing the number of contributing nodes in the routing procedure. In this paper, an energy-aware cluster-based multi-hop routing algorithm is presented, in which the clusters would, if required, re-formed during the routing procedure. Furthermore, like other multi-hop routing algorithms, it guarantees minimizing the energy consumption through balancing energy within the network.

Decentralised reinforcement learning for energy-efficient scheduling in wireless sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1504/IJCNDS.2012.048871,9,article,ACM,2012,"We present a self-organising reinforcement learning (RL) approach for scheduling the wake-up cycles of nodes in a wireless sensor network. The approach is fully decentralised, and allows sensor nodes to schedule their active periods based only on their interactions with neighbouring nodes. Compared to standard scheduling mechanisms such as SMAC, the benefits of the proposed approach are twofold. First, the nodes do not need to synchronise explicitly, since synchronisation is achieved by the successful exchange of data messages in the data collection process. Second, the learning process allows nodes competing for the radio channel to desynchronise in such a way that radio interferences and therefore packet collisions are significantly reduced. This results in shorter communication schedules, allowing to not only reduce energy consumption by reducing the wake-up cycles of sensor nodes, but also to decrease the data retrieval latency. We implement this RL approach in the OMNET&#43;&#43; sensor network simulator, and illustrate how sensor nodes arranged in line, mesh and grid topologies autonomously uncover schedules that favour the successful delivery of messages along a routing tree while avoiding interferences.",none,

Although many core functionalities are well defined, others are left implementation dependent. Among them, the definition of an efficient link-quality estimation (LQE) strategy is of paramount importance, as it influences significantly both the quality of the selected network routes and nodes energy consumption. In this paper, we present RL-Probe, a novel strategy for link quality monitoring in RPL, which accurately measures link quality with minimal overhead and energy waste. To achieve this goal, RL-Probe leverages both synchronous and asynchronous monitoring schemes to maintain up-to-date information on link quality and to promptly react to sudden topology changes, e.g. due to mobility. Our solution relies on a reinforcement learning model to drive the monitoring procedures in order to minimise the overhead caused by active probing operations. The performance of the proposed solution is assessed by means of simulations and real experiments.

Outlier detection in WSN with SVDD via multi-interpolation auto-encoder,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1504/ijics.2023.133368,0,research-article,ACM,2023,"Due to limited resources and harsh deployment environments, data outliers frequently rise in wireless sensor networks (WSNs).

Auto-localization algorithm for mobile sensor nodes in wireless sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11227-024-05920-5,0,research-article,ACM,2024,"In wireless sensor networks, location information is crucial to effectively use the event information recorded by the sensors. However, localizing mobile sensor nodes in resource-constrained networks presents several challenges, including determining the optimal number of anchor nodes, handling mobility, designing a path loss model, considering network topology, and addressing scalability and the number of localized nodes. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a coordinate-based auto-localization algorithm (CALA) with a single anchor node for mobile sensor nodes. The proposed algorithm uses an analytical model to determine the location of the target node by considering a parallel coordinate system and retrieving the original location of the target node by moving it to two different locations. The algorithm uses received signal strength indicator (RSSI) values for distance calculation while considering Rayleigh fading in the path loss model.

QMR: Q-learning based Multi-objective optimization Routing protocol for Flying Ad Hoc Networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.comcom.2019.11.011,17,research-article,ACM,2020,"A network with reliable and rapid communication is critical for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Flying Ad Hoc Networks (FANETs) consisting of UAVs is a new paradigm of wireless communication. However, the highly dynamic topology of FANETs and limited energy of UAVs have brought great challenges to the routing design of FANETs. It is difficult for existing routing protocols for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) and Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) to adapt the high dynamics of FANETs. Moreover, few of existing routing protocols simultaneously meet the requirement of low delay and low energy consumption of FANETs. This paper proposes a novel Q-learning based Multi-objective optimization Routing protocol for FANETs to provide low-delay and low-energy service guarantees. Most of existing Q-learning based protocols use a fixed value for the Q-learning parameters. In contrast, Q-learning parameters can be adaptively adjusted in the proposed protocol to adapt to the high dynamics of FANETs. In addition, a new exploration and exploitation mechanism is also proposed to explore some undiscovered potential optimal routing path while exploiting the acquired knowledge. Instead of using past neighbor relationships, the proposed method re-estimates neighbor relationships in the routing decision process to select the more reliable next hop. Simulation results show that the proposed method can provide higher packet arrival ratio, lower delay and energy consumption than existing good performing Q-learning based routing method.",none,

For example, when the network is a square grid (lattice), at each node of which there is a sensor, and the transmission range does not exceed 2, the problem is polynomially solvable. In this paper, we consider the problem of conflict-free data aggregation in a square grid, when network elements use two frequencies, and the transmission range is at least 2. It consists in finding an energy-efficient conflict-free (we will give later the definition of a conflict) schedule of minimum length for the transfer of aggregated data from all vertices of the lattice to the center node (base station).We find polynomially solvable cases, and also develop an efficient algorithm that builds a schedule with a guaranteed accuracy estimate. For example, when the transmission range is 2, the algorithm constructs either an optimal schedule or a schedule whose length exceeds the optimal latency by no more than 1. For a transmission range more than 2, an estimate of the reduction in the length of the schedule is obtained compared to the case when only one frequency is used.",none,

TDMA scheduling algorithms for wireless sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11276-009-0183-0,50,article,ACM,2010,"Algorithms for scheduling TDMA transmissions in multi-hop networks usually determine the smallest length conflict-free assignment of slots in which each link or node is activated at least once. This is based on the assumption that there are many independent point-to-point flows in the network. In sensor networks however often data are transferred from the sensor nodes to a few central data collectors. The scheduling problem is therefore to determine the smallest length conflict-free assignment of slots during which the packets generated at each node reach their destination. The conflicting node transmissions are determined based on an interference graph, which may be different from connectivity graph due to the broadcast nature of wireless transmissions. We show that this problem is NP-complete. We first propose two centralized heuristic algorithms: one based on direct scheduling of the nodes or node-based scheduling, which is adapted from classical multi-hop scheduling algorithms for general ad hoc networks, and the other based on scheduling the levels in the routing tree before scheduling the nodes or level-based scheduling, which is a novel scheduling algorithm for many-to-one communication in sensor networks. The performance of these algorithms depends on the distribution of the nodes across the levels. We then propose a distributed algorithm based on the distributed coloring of the nodes, that increases the delay by a factor of 10---70 over centralized algorithms for 1000 nodes. We also obtain upper bound for these schedules as a function of the total number of packets generated in the network.",none,

Correlation analysis and statistical characterization of heterogeneous sensor data in environmental sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.comnet.2019.106902,2,research-article,ACM,2019,"In wireless sensor networks, missing data is an inevitable phenomenon due to the inherent limitations of the sensor nodes, such as battery power constraints of nodes, missing communication links, bandwidth limitation, etc. Missing data adversely affects the quality of data received by the sink node. Since the data acquired by the sensor nodes in a multimodal environmental sensor network are spatially and temporally correlated, these correlations play a pivotal role in missing data recovery and data prediction. This paper proposes an analytical framework to characterize the correlation between two different pairs of modalities in an environmental sensor network using a set of classical and robust measures of correlation coefficient estimates. Monte Carlo simulation is performed to approximately model sensed environmental data characteristics. Three classical estimates (Pearson’s correlation coefficient, Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient, and Kendall’s-tau rank correlation coefficient), and four robust estimates of correlation coefficients are used to establish the correlation between different pairs of sensed modalities in the data characteristics. The efficacy of these estimates is obtained using the two performance metrics, mean-squared error (MSE) and relative estimation efficiency (RE). Stationarity analysis among the acquired environmental variables shed light upon the best estimates of the correlation coefficient, which could be used for prediction of temperature modality in a known region of slope/stationarity in the data characteristics.

Due to the denial of service DoS attacks, the distributions of link states could be stochastic benign or adversarial at different temporal and spatial locations. Without any a priori, designing an adaptive and optimal DoS-proof SPR protocol to thwart all possible adversarial attacks is a very challenging issue. In this paper, we present the first such integral solution based on the multi-armed bandit MAB theory, where jamming is the adversarial strategy. By introducing a novel control parameter into the exploration phase for each link, a martingale inequality is applied in our formulated combinatorial adversarial MAB framework. The proposed algorithm could automatically detect the specific jammed and un-jammed links within a unified framework. As a result, the adaptive online SPR strategies with near-optimal learning performance in all possible regimes are obtained.

One of the main challenges in designing WBANs is the routing problem, which is complicated due to dynamic changes in network topology and the limited resources of nodes. Several heuristic and metaheuristic methods have been presented to solve the routing problem in WBANs. Although metaheuristics outperform heuristics by producing higher-quality solutions, they cannot respond to real-time requests. This paper introduces a reactive routing protocol for WBANs that combines a fuzzy heuristic with a metaheuristic learning model. It utilizes a Takagi-Sugeno Fuzzy Inference System in conjunction with the Grey Wolf Optimizer (named TSFIS-GWO). The objective is to simultaneously benefit from the advantages of both approaches, namely, the effectiveness of metaheuristics for offline hyperparameter tuning and the quickness of fuzzy heuristics for real-time routing. At every round, the tuned fuzzy system takes multiple parameters of the current state of the nodes and links to construct the multi-hop routing tree under IEEE 802.15.6. To optimize the performance of the protocol for each WBAN, the fuzzy rules of the TSFIS model are automatically adjusted through a learning method based on GWO. This is done in accordance with the specific requirements of the application, and the tuning process takes place once before the protocol is applied. Simulation results in three applications demonstrate that the proposed TSFIS-GWO model is capable of providing real-time solutions while outperforming the existing methods in terms of application-specific performance measures.Highlights•Introducing a hybrid heuristic-metaheuristic routing protocol for WBANs.•Presenting a heuristic Takagi-Sugeno FIS (TSFIS) for just-in-time routing.•Applying a metaheuristic-driven GWO for optimizing the TSFIS model.•Utilizing a tunable fitness function based on the application specifications.",none,

In this work, we develop a mixed-integer linear programming model to maximize the network lifetime by optimally determining locations of sensors and sinks, activity schedules of deployed sensors, and sensor-to-sink data flow routes over a finite planning horizon subject to coverage, flow conservation, energy consumption, and budget constraints. Unfortunately, the exact solution of this model is difficult even for small problem instances.

Particularly, 34 research studies published during 2012-2020 have been selected and examined in the area of UWSNs. This leads to the identification of 21 modern routing protocols and 11 tools. Furthermore, 5 different architecture types and 3 communication media technologies are presented in the context of UWSNs. Finally, a comparative analysis of routing protocols is done on the basis of important evaluation metrics. It has been concluded that there exist adequate approaches, protocols and tools for the monitoring of UWSNs. However, the design verification capabilities of existing approaches are insufficient to meet the growing demands of UWSNs.

LT Codes and the Minimum Spanning Tree Based Distributed Storage in Wireless Sensor Networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11036-018-1173-1,0,research-article,ACM,2022,"In wireless sensor networks, sensor nodes are vulnerable due to the challenging environment and limited energy. Once a sensor node fails, the stored sensed data will be lost. In this paper, we develop a distributed algorithm for solving this problem based on the fountain codes and the minimum spanning tree. Similar to previous works, we adopt the Luby Transform (LT) codes, the first practical scheme of fountain codes, in our algorithm. However, different from the previous schemes, our algorithm deploys the minimum spanning tree instead of the random walk. Due to the fact that all nodes in the wireless sensor networks do not have the location information of other nodes, we use the Gallager-Humble-Spira (GHS) algorithm to generate a distributed minimum spanning tree. Data packets can be transmitted through the tree and easily reach every node in the network. We obtain the performance of the algorithm through simulations, which show that our algorithm consumes less number of the transmissions compared with the existing algorithms using the random walk.",none,
Distributed Multilevel k-Coverage Energy-Efficient Fault-Tolerant Scheduling for Wireless Sensor Networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11277-022-09495-3,0,research-article,ACM,2022,"The expected k-coverage, prolonged network lifetime, and fault-tolerance capabilities play a vital role in the success of various application operations in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), as they are the key performance indicators of WSNs. The k-coverage protocol ensures that the entire target region of interest (R) is the whole k-covered, where R can further be distributed into several target subregions. The distribution of target subregions is based on the field’s vulnerability. The value of k is higher for subregions with higher vulnerability. More explicitly, some applications request a high level of k-coverage for a portion of R that is highly vulnerable; such applications never demand a flat k-coverage for their entire R. Thus, more sensors have to be unnecessarily active to provide a flat k-coverage. Some of the sensors stop working before their expected battery lifetime, due to which the network’s overall lifetime and functionality are influenced. Therefore, instead of flat k-coverage scheduling, we propose a distributed multilevel k-coverage, energy-efficient, and fault-tolerant scheduling protocol (named DkCEFS). The average time and the communication overhead of DkCEFS is O(nlogn). Simulation results proves that DkCEFS maintain the multilevel k-coverage ratio up to 40–45% compared to flat k-coverage and prolonging the average network lifetime up to 30–40% more with fault-tolerance capabilities. We also analyzed that distributed multilevel k-coverage conserve more energy than a distribution of a flat k-coverage in a stipulated network lifetime.

Intelligent Networking for Energy Harvesting Powered IoT Systems,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3638765,0,research-article,ACM,2024,"As the next-generation battery substitute for IoT system, energy harvesting (EH) technology revolutionizes the IoT industry with environmental friendliness, ubiquitous accessibility, and sustainability, which enables various self-sustaining IoT applications. However, due to the weak and intermittent nature of EH power, the performance of EH-powered IoT systems as well as its collaborative routing mechanism can severely deteriorate, rendering unpleasant data package loss during each power failure. Such a phenomenon makes conventional routing policies and energy allocation strategies impractical. Given the complexity of the problem, reinforcement learning (RL) appears to be one of the most promising and applicable methods to address this challenge. Nevertheless, although the energy allocation and routing policy are jointly optimized by the RL method, due to the energy restriction of EH devices, the inappropriate configuration of multi-hop network topology severely degrades the data collection performance. Therefore, this article first conducts a thorough mathematical discussion and develops the topology design and validation algorithm under energy harvesting scenarios. Then, this article develops DeepIoTRouting, a distributed and scalable deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach, to address the routing and energy allocation jointly for the energy harvesting powered distributed IoT system.

Multi-level trust-based secure and optimal IoT-WSN routing for environmental monitoring applications,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11227-023-05875-z,0,research-article,ACM,2024,"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are a critical component of the Internet of Things (IoT) which can be used in various fields, including environmental monitoring, smart agriculture, etc. However, WSNs used in environmental monitoring particularly in border areas are vulnerable to various security threats caused by illegal intruders who perform eavesdropping, garnishing, gray-hole attacks, etc. to compromise the network and forge the sensitive data. A multi-level hierarchical secure and optimal routing (ML-HSOR) protocol is proposed to overcome these issues. The proposed ML-HSOR protocol has four stages: registration, clustering, authentication, and optimal routing. In the registration step, the new sensor nodes are registered with the base station (BS) using unique identities. In the clustering stage, a Markov model with adaptive weighting mechanism is used to choose the most suitable node as the cluster head (CH), enhancing network lifespan and performance. The authentication stage involves a multi-level trust evaluation to detect malicious nodes. The aggregated message and timestamp are encrypted, and finally, the optimal data transmission path is chosen based on the polarity learning-based chimp optimization algorithm (PL-COA).

Dynamic Sensor Scheduling for Data Size Reduction in a Sensor Cloud System Based on Minimum Reconstruction Error,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11277-024-11090-7,0,research-article,ACM,2024,"Sensing and subsequent analysis of the environmental data of a given geographical area is an essential requisite for the planned development of that region.

In a large Wireless Sensor Network formed by the IoT sensors, there will be a significant amount of redundancy in the dataset when the nodes are placed closely, and the sensed data varies slowly and gradually with regard to time and space. Then, avoiding redundant data transmission can lead to lower energy consumption and communication overhead. Adaptive subset selection of sensor nodes for data size reduction in a Wireless Sensor Network is an approach to efficiently managing the amount of data transmitted within the network. Then, in the current time schedule, it is possible to optimally select a subset of the sensor nodes for data collection without very much affecting the overall data fidelity. An optimal sensor node subset selection scheme that reduces the communication load with minimum information loss is proposed to achieve this task. The unselected nodes are put in sleep mode, which consequently results in lower sensor energy expenditure. The subset selection algorithm is implemented based on the derivative-free pattern search optimizer that minimizes the reconstruction error during the associated extrapolation. This approach differs entirely from the Compressive Data Gathering approach. The simulation results reveal that the performance of the proposed scheme is superior to other similar competitive methods in terms of the mean square error, which is found to be 1.95, with the percentage participation nodes equal to 50% and when the sensor data is uniformly distributed over 20 and 30 units.",none,

An efficient energy-aware and reliable routing protocol to enhance the performance of wireless body area networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11227-024-06039-3,0,research-article,ACM,2024,"A wireless body area network (WBAN) is a type of wireless sensor network that plays a crucial role in monitoring patient healthcare. In this network, sensor nodes are typically placed inside or outside the patient’s body. These nodes are capable of transmitting data to the sink node when any functional changes in the patient are detected. The routing and energy efficiency of the network nodes are challenging tasks in WBAN, as each sensor node operates on a battery. Therefore, in multi-hop routing designing a robust routing protocol has a significant impact on reducing energy consumption during the selection of the next hop. In this paper, a simple novel routing protocol named simple energy-aware and reliable (SEAR) routing protocol is proposed to transmit reliable data packets in a WBAN. The proposed routing scheme considers the remaining energy of sensor nodes, priority data, and hop count to the sink node as significant metrics for dynamically selecting the best forwarder node. Furthermore, the proposed protocol utilizes the route reliability factor (RRF) to select the optimal route among all possible routes between the source sensor node and the sink node. RRF selects the route with the maximum route residual energy and minimum hop count. As a result, SEAR has the ability to provide effective single-hop and multi-hop routing data transmission to improve the reliability of data transmission, decrease the energy consumption of the sensor nodes, and prolong the lifetime of the network. The simulation results show that the performance of the SEAR routing protocol outperforms the existing routing protocols for the metrics: packet loss ratio, throughput, end-to-end delay, normalized routing load, energy consumption, and network lifetime. The results indicate that the proposed protocol improves total energy consumption by 18.76% and 10.89% when compared to EERR-RLFL and AMCRP respectively.

DeepGANTT: A Scalable Deep Learning Scheduler for Backscatter Networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3583120.3586957,0,research-article,ACM,2023,"Novel backscatter communication techniques enable battery-free sensor tags to interoperate with unmodified standard IoT devices, extending a sensor network’s capabilities in a scalable manner. Without requiring additional dedicated infrastructure, the battery-free tags harvest energy from the environment, while the IoT devices provide them with the unmodulated carrier they need to communicate. A schedule coordinates the provision of carriers for the communications of battery-free devices with IoT nodes. Optimal carrier scheduling is an NP-hard problem that limits the scalability of network deployments. Thus, existing solutions waste energy and other valuable resources by scheduling the carriers suboptimally. We present DeepGANTT, a deep learning scheduler that leverages graph neural networks to efficiently provide near-optimal carrier scheduling. We train our scheduler with optimal schedules of relatively small networks obtained from a constraint optimization solver, achieving a performance within 3% of the optimum. Without the need to retrain, our scheduler generalizes to networks 6 × larger in the number of nodes and 10 × larger in the number of tags than those used for training. DeepGANTT breaks the scalability limitations of the optimal scheduler and reduces carrier utilization by up to compared to the state-of-the-art heuristic.

Fast Data Collection in Tree-Based Wireless Sensor Networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TMC.2011.22,58,research-article,ACM,2012,"We investigate the following fundamental question—how fast can information be collected from a wireless sensor network organized as tree? To address this, we explore and evaluate a number of different techniques using realistic simulation models under the many-to-one communication paradigm known as convergecast. We first consider time scheduling on a single frequency channel with the aim of minimizing the number of time slots required (schedule length) to complete a convergecast. Next, we combine scheduling with transmission power control to mitigate the effects of interference, and show that while power control helps in reducing the schedule length under a single frequency, scheduling transmissions using multiple frequencies is more efficient. We give lower bounds on the schedule length when interference is completely eliminated, and propose algorithms that achieve these bounds. We also evaluate the performance of various channel assignment methods and find empirically that for moderate size networks of about 100 nodes, the use of multifrequency scheduling can suffice to eliminate most of the interference. Then, the data collection rate no longer remains limited by interference but by the topology of the routing tree. To this end, we construct degree-constrained spanning trees and capacitated minimal spanning trees, and show significant improvement in scheduling performance over different deployment densities. Lastly, we evaluate the impact of different interference and channel models on the schedule length.",none,

WSNs have strict resource constraints such as limited bandwidth, limited energy, limited processing capability, and limited memory. Among them, the most critical one is limited energy. So, energy efficiency has got significant importance in the WSNs. Energy consumption is mainly due to computation and communication between sensor nodes and the base station. Energy consumption for communication is more when compared to computation. Hence it is indispensable to focus on designing an energy-efficient routing for WSN.

Several applications in the IoT require the efficient and timely collection of larger amounts of data. Due to the interference and contention over the wireless medium, the limited bandwidth of the radios, the limited resources of the battery-operated sensor nodes, this requirement becomes a challenging task. In this research, we exploit the multi-channel operation capability of the radios to provide the higher network throughput and propose an efficient scheduling algorithm to eliminate collision, idle-listening or over-hearing, which are consequences of non-coordinated transmissions. Our work focuses on scheduling the regular traffic that is periodically transmitted and on adapting the schedule to the additional traffic that can be requested at some point in time. To deploy the schedule-based multi-channel protocol on real applications, we design the complete communication procedure that is necessary for sensor nodes to communicate among them to form a network and to propagate the sensed data to the collection point. We also propose a low-overhead time synchronization scheme that is critical for a schedule-based protocol. The results of extensive simulation experiments show that the proposed scheduling algorithm can achieve collision-free parallel transmissions over different channels to provide high throughput and high delivery ratio while meeting the crucial energy efficiency requirements. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility of the protocol and the time synchronization scheme on a laboratory-scaled test-bed of real motes.",none,

DIGEST: a decentralized divergecast scheduling algorithm for IEEE 802.15.4e TSCH in the internet of things,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11276-021-02722-y,0,research-article,ACM,2021,"Internet of Things is emerging as a commercial phenomenon. It is conjectured that billions of appliances will be connected within the current Internet infrastructure by 2020. These networked appliances require low-power radio and reliability. Hence, IEEE brought up a very efficient, reliable and deterministic time-frequency enabled medium access control protocol, IEEE 802.15.4e time slotted channel hopping (TSCH), on top of low power IEEE 802.15.4 radio for the industrial market. IEEE 802.15.4e TSCH is able to run a communication schedule for MAC upon a communication schedule is built. However, the issue of how such scheduling will be made, updated, and maintained is beyond the scope of the IEEE 802.15.4e TSCH standard. The unit responsible for these tasks is also out of its scope. That means, required scheduling mechanism is absent in this standard. In order to complete this gap, several communication scheduling algorithms are introduced in the literature. In this study, we first introduce another decentralized divergecast communication scheduling algorithm, called as DIGEST, where divergecast implies that network traffic moves in any directions opposed to convergecast where network traffic moves from leave nodes to root. That DIGEST algorithm tries to schedule time slots by selecting a neighbor node at first. When choosing a neighbor node, it tries to make almost equal number of dedicated time slots to each neighbor. In this way, it can provide better schedules with neighbor nodes than other scheduling algorithms. We evaluate the effectiveness of DIGEST, Diva, and Berkeley’s Aloha-based scheduling algorithms under static and mobile environments by running extensive simulations.

GD3N: Adaptive clustering-based detection of selective forwarding attacks in WSNs under variable harsh environments,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.ins.2024.120375,0,research-article,ACM,2024,"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are susceptible to numerous security threats due to their reliance on open environments and broadcast communication methods. Among these, the selective forwarding attack is notably challenging to detect. This difficulty arises from the ability of malicious nodes to imitate the behavior of normal nodes, and selectively drop data packets, which makes them virtually indistinguishable from normal ones, particularly under conditions of poor channel quality. To address this challenge with harsh environments, we introduce a novel methodology termed GD3N. This approach is underpinned by the design of a unique type of data point that encapsulates both short-term and long-term forwarding behaviors of nodes. It combines a refined version of the Gradient Diffusion Density-based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (GD-DBSCAN) algorithm, with a novel Double-Parameter Neighbor Voting (DP-NV) method based on the data set. These innovations contribute to a significant enhancement in detection accuracy and a reduction in computational complexity when compared to traditional DBSCAN and NV methods.

Several cross-layer routing/MAC schemes have been proposed to mitigate this latency. However, they utilize routing information from a single flow and/or a single packet perspective, thus limiting their adaptation to varying traffic loads and patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel Cross-Layer MAC protocol (CL-MAC) for WSNs, to efficiently handle multi-packet, multi-hop and multi-flow traffic patterns while adapting to a wide range of traffic loads. CL-MAC's scheduling is based on a unique structure of flow setup packets that efficiently utilize routing information to transmit multiple data packets over multiple multi-hop flows. Unlike other MAC protocols, supporting construction of multi-hop flows, CL-MAC considers all pending packets in the routing layer buffer and all flow setup requests from neighbors, when setting up a flow. This allows CL-MAC to make more informed scheduling decisions, reflecting the current network status, and dynamically optimize its scheduling mechanism accordingly. We evaluate CL-MAC through extensive ns-2 simulations and compare its performance to the state of the art, over various networks and for a wide variety of traffic loads and patterns. In all our experiments, CL-MAC substantially reduces end-to-end latency, increases delivery ratio while reducing the average energy consumed per packet delivered.",none,

Each router part of the graph sends DODAG information object (DIO) control messages and specifies its rank within the graph, indicating its position within the network relative to the root. When a node receives a DIO message, it determines its network rank, which must be higher than all its parents’ rank, and then continues sending DIO messages using the trickle timer.

To resolve the existing issues, we proposed DAG-based BLOCKchain-Routing and Load Balancing Model (DBLOCK-RLB). The proposed approach performs routing and load balancing in the SDWSN environment in an energy efficient manner with high security. The SDWSN environment is composed of four major planes as data plane, switch plane, control plane, and application plane. The sensor nodes in the data plane are authenticated priory to ensure legitimacy and reduce unwanted network traffics by adopting Camellia Encryption Algorithm (CAE) which provides secret key to the user by considering several metrics. The authenticated sensor nodes are clustered to reduce energy consumption using Adaptive Threshold based Network Partitioning in which the circular SDWSN environment is split into equal parts and optimal Cluster Head selection is done by considering clustering metrics. From the clustered network, the CH is responsible for intelligent routing.

We formulate the problem as a slot assignment problem where each node needs to obtain slots for upstream and downstream transmissions while avoiding interferences. We propose two efficient slot assignment algorithms based on the concept of sequencing nodes' slots to facilitate two-way traffics. We show the advantages of these schemes through extensive simulations. The results indicate that these two slot assignment algorithms can indeed achieve low-latency in ZigBee networks.",none,
Q-learning based routing for in-network aggregation in wireless sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11276-021-02564-8,1,research-article,ACM,2021,"In-network data aggregation is an inherent paradigm that extends the lifetime of resource-constrained wireless sensor networks (WSNs). By aggregating sensor data at intermediate nodes, it eliminates data redundancy, minimizes the number of transmissions and saves energy. A key component of in-network data aggregation is the design of an optimal routing structure. However, when the monitoring environment is highly dynamic, the conventional in-network aggregation routing algorithms lead to unnecessary redesign, high overhead and inferior performance, and make in-network aggregation a challenging task. This paper proposes a novel adaptive routing algorithm for in-network aggregation (RINA) in wireless sensor networks. The proposed approach employs a reinforcement learning method called Q-learning to build a routing tree based on minimal information such as residual energy, distance between nodes and link strength. In addition, it finds the aggregation points in the routing structure to maximize the number of overlapping routes in order to increase the aggregation ratio. Theoretical analysis proves the feasibility of the proposed approach. Simulation results show that the aggregation tree constructed by RINA increases the network lifetime by achieving optimum data aggregation and outperform other state-of-the-art approaches in terms of different significant features under different simulation scenarios.",none,

Most of the current work does not consider the variability of scenarios and how many mobile chargers should be scheduled as the most appropriate for each dispatch. At the same time, the focus of most work on the mobile charger scheduling problem has always been on reducing the number of dead nodes, and the most critical metric of network performance, packet arrival rate, is relatively neglected.

Then, a Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm is employed to train a decision model using environmental information to select which request allocation algorithm is optimal for the current scenario. After the allocation of charging requests is confirmed, to improve the Quality of Service, i.e., the packet arrival rate of the entire network, a partial charging scheduling algorithm is designed to maximize the total charging duration of nodes in the ideal state while ensuring that all charging requests are completed.

Energy efficient routing using adaptive elephant herding optimization for IoT-WSN,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.3233/JIFS-224251,0,research-article,ACM,2023,"WSNs(Wireless Sensor Networks) has been developed with applications in many domains including agriculture, telecommunication, manufacturing industry, healthcare, and surveillance. More specifically, WSN plays a pivotal role in IoT (Internet of Things). The IoT sensors provide information about the physical phenomena in the deployed fields. As the sensors contain only limited resources, the factors like data processing, power consumption, transmission, and storage capabilities adversely affect the efficiency. Thus, the process of routing is necessary for network longevity. The data from IoT-based sensors is routed to the destination through a multi-hop routing system. The Energy aware Routing is motivated by the nature inspired Fuzzy Butterfly Optimization (E2RFBOA). Further a new data aggregation method is introduced in this article customized for IoT based WSN to acquaint higher crop yield in precision farming. Nevertheless, the scalability becomes a primary concern when deployed in larger and denser networks. This is due to the fact that all nodes in IoT and WSN are mostly alive depending on higher usage of bandwidth and power. The primal aim is to build a novel routing protocol developed for IoT-WSN. Apart from this, an Energy aware Clustered Routing that is motivated by Adaptive Elephant Herding Optimization (E2CR-AEHO) is proposed, which sensors collect data and find a group of Cluster Heads (CHs).

An attacker may exploit vulnerabilities of IoT entities and compromise users’ security and privacy. Development of solutions to address security and privacy issues of IoT is in premature stage and considered as challenge. This challenge becomes more critical when the devices in the network are resource-constrained in terms of energy, processing and memory. The IPv6 over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) has emerged in recent years as an adaptation layer to carry IPv6 packets over IEEE 802 . 15 . 4. Many IoT applications use Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) as a network layer protocol developed for routing in 6LoWPAN. Security is challenging in resource constrained environment where encryption may not be a viable solution. Version number attack is one of the most common network layer attacks against RPL based 6LoWPAN.

Unlike traditional networks, such as TCP/IP Internet, DTNs are often subject to high latency caused by very long propagation delays (e.g., interplanetary communication) and/or intermittent connectivity. In DTNs there is no guarantee of end-to-end connectivity between source and destination. Such distinct features pose a number of technical challenges in designing core network functions such as routing and congestion control mechanisms. Detecting and dealing with congestion in DTNs is an important problem since congestion can significantly deteriorate DTN performance.

Smart-DTN-CC is an adaptive and distributed congestion aware framework that mitigates congestion using reinforcement learning, a machine learning technique known to be well suited to problems where: (1) the environment, in this case the network, plays a crucial role; and (2) yet, no prior knowledge about the target environment can be assumed, i.e., the only way to acquire information about the environment is to interact with it through continuous online learning.Smart-DTN-CC nodes receive input from the environment (e.g., buffer occupancy, neighborhood membership, etc), and, based on that information, choose an action to take from a set of possible actions. Depending on the selected action’s effectiveness in controlling congestion, a reward will be given. Smart-DTN-CC’s goal is to maximize the overall reward which translates to minimizing congestion.

While an agent works in a multi-agent system, the number of messages between them increases. This is due to the fact that the functionalities data depends on other agents in terms of functional requirements. Typically, only one agent in a multi-agent system is responsible for accessing a database instead of replicating the database on each agent. A database is stored on multiple agents rather than a single agent to avoid a single point of failure. In this approach, the system has a higher load because one agent is responsible for all agent queries and must send duplicate messages to multiple agents, resulting in redundant data.

Basically, FGT aim is to allow involved classes with different QoS requirements to fairly gain a part of the available channel resources to transmit their flows. Adhere, on every LTE-frame, a cooperative game scenario is designed. Wherein, Shapley formula is used to distribute the available amount of data within RT and NRT traffic classes.

Optimal Spectrum Allocation Based on Primary User Activity Model in Cognitive Radio Wireless Sensor Networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11277-020-08009-3,0,research-article,ACM,2021,"In Cognitive Radio Wireless Sensor Networks, the licensed spectrum bands are highly dynamic, and their status varies overtime. With the expansion of these networks, regarding the energy constraints and the fact that reallocation of the frequency spectrum is energy-consuming, the problem of controlling the behavior of secondary users in the allocation of the spectrum is of great importance. Providing a method to reduce the number of channel reallocation, which in turn results in reducing energy consumption in such a dynamical network is essential. In this paper, considering the energy constraints, an optimal method for allocating frequency spectrum resources is presented using game theory and Nash equilibrium. By analyzing the activity model of primary users on the frequency spectrum and selecting the appropriate spectrum using the Nash equilibrium, the method reaches the network to a stationary equilibrium point. In these conditions, in addition to reducing interference between primary and secondary users, the number of channel reallocations by cognitive radio users is reduced and thus reduces overall energy consumption in the network and increases its life span.",none,

Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) is a promising technology for delivering quality healthcare to its users. Low power devices attached to the body have limited battery life. It is desirable to have energy efficient routing protocols that maintain the required reliability value for sending the data from a given node to the sink. The current work proposes two protocols: Optimized Cost Effective and Energy Efficient Routing protocol (OCER) and Extended-OCER (E-OCER). In OCER, optimization using Genetic Algorithm (GA) is applied to the multi-objective cost function with residual energy, link reliability and path loss as its parameters for selecting the most optimal route from a given body coordinator to the sink. Distance between any two sensor nodes is reduced by applying multi-hop approach. E-OCER extends the work of OCER by considering inter-BAN communication.

The main idea is to train SVM classifier using only the local dataset, and evaluate the global nonlinear classifier via a dynamic consensus algorithm with communication only between neighbors instead of among all agents (sensor node) in the network. Specifically, by introducing a sequential gradient ascent based algorithm and modifying the formulation of the bias, the training process can be executed in a distributed and parallel way without information exchange among agents. After the distributed training of SVM, each node has one set of Lagrange multipliers corresponding to the local dataset. Then we adopt the dynamic consensus algorithm to evaluate the global nonlinear classifier for each agent in the network with only information exchange between neighbors. A novel dynamic consensus formulation is introduced and its convergence is proved. What's more, since it only exchanges information between neighbors during evaluation, the proposed algorithm is scalable for large-scale ad hoc sensor network and considerable communication energy can be reduced, which will prolong the lifetime of the whole network.

A study towards applying thermal inertia for energy conservation in rooms,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2529050,12,research-article,ACM,2013,"We are in an age where people are paying increasing attention to energy conservation around the world. The heating and air-conditioning systems of buildings introduce one of the largest chunks of energy expenses. In this article, we make a key observation that after a meeting or a class ends in a room, the indoor temperature will not immediately increase to the outdoor temperature. We call this phenomenon thermal inertia. Thus, if we arrange subsequent meetings in the same room rather than in a room that has not been used for some time, we can take advantage of such undissipated cool or heated air and conserve energy. Though many existing energy conservation solutions for buildings can intelligently turn off facilities when people are absent, we believe that understanding thermal inertia can lead system designs to go beyond on-and-off-based solutions to a wider realm.We propose a framework for exploring thermal inertia in room management. Our framework contains two components. (1) The energy-temperature correlation model captures the relation between indoor temperature change and energy consumption. (2) The energy-aware scheduling algorithms: given information for the relation between energy and temperature change, energy-aware scheduling algorithms arrange meetings not only based on common restrictions, such as meeting time and room capacity requirement, but also energy consumptions. We identify the interface between these components so further works towards same on direction can make efforts on individual components.We develop a system to verify our framework. First, it has a wireless sensor network to collect indoor, outdoor temperature and electricity expenses of the heating or air-conditioning devices. Second, we build an energy-temperature correlation model for the energy expenses and the corresponding room temperature. Third, we develop room scheduling algorithms. In detail, we first extend the current sensor hardware so that it can record the electricity expenses in re-heating or re-cooling a room. As the sensor network needs to work unattendedly, we develop a hardware board for long-range communications so that the Imote2 can send data to a remote server without a computer relay close by.

Load Balancing Technique for Congestion Control Multipath Routing Protocol in MANETs,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11277-016-3575-3,8,article,ACM,2017,"A mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is a collection of wireless mobile nodes that can communicate without a central controller or fixed infrastructure. Due to node mobility, designing a routing protocol to provide an efficient and suitable method to route the data with less energy consumption, packet drop and to prolong the network lifetime has become a challenging issue in MANETs. In MANETs, reducing energy consumption and packet loss involves congestion control and load balancing techniques. Thus, this paper introduces an efficient routing technique called the multipath load balancing technique for congestion control (MLBCC) in MANETs to efficiently balance the load among multiple paths by reducing the congestion. MLBCC introduces a congestion control mechanism and a load balancing mechanism during the data transmission process. The congestion control mechanism detects the congestion by using an arrival rate and an outgoing rate at a particular time interval T. The load balancing mechanism selects a gateway node by using the link cost and the path cost to efficiently distribute the load by selecting the most desirable paths. For an efficient flow of distribution, a node availability degree standard deviation parameter is introduced. Simulation results of MLBCC show the performance improvements in terms of the control overhead, packet delivery ratio, average delay and packet drop ratio in comparison with Fibonacci sequence multipath load balancing, stable backbone-based multipath routing protocol and ad hoc on demand multipath distance vector routing.

The need for low power radio networks first led to low duty cycle approaches where nodes turn off their radio chipset most of the time to save energy. The medium access control (MAC) has thus been largely investigated over the last fifteen years. Unfortunately, classical contention access methods use a random access and are unable to provide guarantees. In the meantime, some dedicated standards have emerged (e.g. IEEE 802.15.4-2006, IEEE 802.15.4-2015), combining Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) with slow channel hopping in order to enable reliability and energy efficiency. Slow channel hopping allows each node to use different channels for a frame and its possible retransmissions with a low-cost hardware.

This exponential growth in demand, both in terms of the number of devices and Quality of Service (QoS) had spawned the concept of cross-layer optimization several years ago. The primary goal of the cross-layer approach was to liberate the strict boundary between the layers of the traditional Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) protocol stack. The objective was to enable information flow between layers which then can be leveraged to optimize the network’s performance across the layers mitigating the challenges due to scarce resources while meeting QoS demands. The initial decade focused on establishing the theoretical feasibility of this revolutionary concept and gauging the effectiveness and limits of this idea. During the next phase, the advent of software defined radios (SDR) accelerated the growth of this domain due to its added flexibility. Even with the immense interest and progress in this area of research, there has been a gaping abyss between solutions designed in theory and ones deployed in practice. To establish this, we first present an elaborate survey of the cross-layer protocol stack literature with emphasis on their maturity scale.

Intelligent traffic light scheduling technique using calendar-based history information,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.future.2018.08.037,1,research-article,ACM,2019,"One of the most serious problems that are due to the vast increase in the number of vehicles, is the traffic congestion. The severe traffic congestion in modern large cities puts huge pressure on the decision makers to invest in planning and deploying solutions to this problem. Using a proper traffic management methodology could alleviate the traffic congestion problem and contribute to the reduction in traffic jams. Several algorithms for traffic management were presented in the literature. In this paper, we propose a new novel history-based traffic management algorithm that relies on the previous all-year traffic information to predict the traffic flow on congested streets of a crowded city. Thus, we refer to this proposed technique as a calendar-based traffic congestion management system. The main idea is to use the recorded traffic history information to compute the green/red times for each direction on a congested intersection with a traffic light controller. A robust heuristic is proposed to use the history information in predicting the future traffic load on each street leading to an intersection controlled by a traffic light. The proposed algorithm is implemented and tested using MATLAB and the well-known traffic simulator, SUMO. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm optimizes the traffic flow up to 18% more than a standard traffic system. We also apply the proposed algorithm using a multi-intersection model composed of a mesh of 4x4 intersections, and compare the results with other traffic time management approaches, such as the History-Based Self-Organizing Traffic Lights, HB-SOTL.

In this network, a camera node (CN) captures images and transmits them to a base station (BS). Several sensor nodes (SNs) are also placed throughout the network to facilitate the proper functioning of the network. Transmitting an image requires a large amount of energy due to the image size and distance; however, SNs are resource constrained. Image compression is used to scale down image size; however, it is accompanied by a computational complexity trade-off. Moreover, direct image transmission to a BS requires more energy.

By using the Time-Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) mode of the IEEE 802.15.4e MAC layer, wireless multi-hop networks enable highly reliable and low-power communication, supporting mission-critical and industrial applications. TSCH uses channel hopping to avoid both external interference and multi-path fading, and a synchronization-based schedule which allows precise bandwidth allocation. Efficient schedule management is crucial when minimizing the delay of a packet to reach its destination. In networks with recurrent sensor data transmissions that repeat after a certain period, current scheduling functions are prone to high latencies by ignoring this recurrent behavior. In this article, we propose a TSCH scheduling function that tackles this minimal-latency recurrent traffic problem. Concretely, this work presents two novel contributions. First, the recurrent traffic problem is defined formally as an Integer Linear Program. Second, we propose the Recurrent Low-Latency Scheduling Function (ReSF) that reserves minimal-latency paths from source to sink and only activates these paths when recurrent traffic is expected.

In this attack, the adversary captures the sensor node(s) and extracts all important information, properties, and functions. Then, it disrupts the network operation by generating several malicious nodes having the same ID(s) as that of the captured node(s). Since the malicious nodes (i.e., replica nodes) have valid keying material, they can intentionally interfere with the network operation. Motivated by this, a three-step mechanism is proposed to detect replica nodes. The proposed mechanism benefits from watchdog nodes and is based on the idea that all nodes in the network (which are identified by their unique IDs) should have the same chance to be met by watchdog nodes. Accordingly, watchdog nodes monitor the network traffic and silently overhear the channel to see if there is any node with an abnormally higher chance of being met. If so, the ID of the node is advertised as the replica node.To evaluate the performance of the proposed mechanism in terms of probability of detecting replica nodes and false detection probability, a comprehensive set of simulations has been carried out using the J-SIM simulator. The simulation results reveal that the proposed mechanism detects almost all replica nodes while the false detection probability is below 0.005%.

As network devices in these data centers continue to increase at a high rate, efficient route management to handle these devices’ vast amounts of data has emerged as a significant concern. This work suggests a novel admission and routing scheme considering the importance or priorities of the network flows, path energy, and routing path load. Using the SDN paradigm in DCN (Data Center Network), we first develop a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation by jointly considering flow priority, path energy, and path load. The MILP formulation can maximize the number of flows as well as minimize the energy consumption and load variance in the network, or it can make a trade-off among all three. However, due to the potentially long running time, later, we introduce two greedy methods, Priority Based Energy Minimization Algorithm (PEMA) and Priority Based Evenly Load Distribution Algorithm (PEDL), where PEMA aims to maximize the flow with less energy, and PEDL focuses on maximizing the flow with reduced load variation. Finally, the developed routing strategies are implemented, and the simulation results demonstrate the out-performance of our work compared to the existing works in terms of successful flow ratio, energy savings, and load balancing.",none,

An optimal Q-learning based clustering and load balancing technique using improved K-Means algorithm is proposed. It contains two phases namely clustering phase and node balancing phase. The proposed algorithm uses Q-learning technique for deploying sensor nodes in appropriate clusters and cluster head CH election. In the clustering phase, the node will be placed in appropriate clusters based on the computation of the mean values. Once the sensors are placed in an appropriate cluster, then the cluster will be divided into ‘k’ partitions. The node which is having maximum residual energy in each partition will be elected as the partition head PH. In node balancing phase, the number of sensors in each partition will be evenly distributed by considering the area of the cluster and the number of sensors inside the cluster. Among the PHs, the node which is having residual energy to the maximum and also having the minimal distance to the sink is elected as the CH. The residual energy of the CH is monitored periodically. If it falls below the threshold level, then another partition head PH which is having residual energy to the maximum level and possessing minimum distance to the sink node will be elected as CH.

There are certain limitations in designing the scheduling path when sensor nodes consume diversified energy. Previous charging schedule approaches or charging path designs aimed to reduce the mobile charger’s travel distance as well as the charging time delay.

Pandemics have redefined some of the basic beliefs of modern healthcare, pushing researchers and scientists to develop innovative solutions to be better equipped for future emergencies. Numerous attempts have been made to fight Covid-19-like pandemics using technologies such as the Internet of Things, wireless body area network, blockchain, and machine learning.

The application of machine learning (ML) methods has become of high importance to facilitate the prolific deployment of TIoT devices and applications. Along with advances in 6G and networking-enabling technologies, federated learning (FL) can bridge this gap by boosting TIoT services due to its inherent and redundant distributed nature. To the best of our knowledge, no other work in the literature covers applications of FL in the TIoT.

Toward Performant and Energy-Efficient Network Queries: A Parallel and Stateless Approach,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1155/2023/6185758,0,research-article,ACM,2023,"In many edge computing applications (e.g., wireless sensor networks, WSNs) where nodes are mostly battery-powered, queries’ energy consumption, and response time are two of the most important metrics, representing the network’s sustainability and performance, respectively. Conventional techniques used to focus on only one of the two metrics and did not attempt to optimize both in a coordinated manner. This work aims to achieve both high sustainability and high performance of these queries at the same time. To that end, a new mechanism is proposed to construct the topology of a three-tier WSN. The proposed mechanism eliminates the conventional stateful routing tables and employs a stateless and efficient addressing scheme inspired by the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT). The CRT-based topology allows for query parallelism, an unprecedented feature in the WSNs. On top of the new topology encoded by CRT, a new protocol is designed to parallelly preprocess collected data on sensor nodes by effectively aggregating and deduplicating data in a cluster of neighborhood nodes. At the same time, the hibernating mechanism is proposed to prolong the network life cycle. Moreover, a new algorithm is devised to allow the queries and results to be transmitted through low-power and fault-tolerant paths using recursive elections over a subset of the entire power range. With all these new techniques taken together, the system presented in this work outperforms approximate algorithms from various perspectives: (i) the query response is improved by up to 21.6%; (ii) the energy consumption is reduced by up to 16.8%; and (iii) the reliability is increased by up to 18.3%.",none,

Thus, to achieve a green IoT network with minimum delay, this paper addresses the energy conservation issue in these networks by proposing a Cross-zone based Routing mechanism for IoT–based WSN (CRIoT). CRIoT has more control over the routing tree by using a grid-based virtual structure with cells of different sizes that are formed by connecting several smaller cross-shaped pieces.

Near Optimal Charging and Scheduling Scheme for Stochastic Event Capture with Rechargeable Sensors,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/MASS.2013.60,3,Article,ACM,2013,"Though much existing work exploits wireless power charging to enhance sensor network performance such as routing and data aggregation, few efforts focus on issues of stochastic event capture. In this paper, we consider the scenario in which a mobile charger (MC) periodically travels within a sensor network to recharge the sensors wirelessly, to maximize the Quality of Monitoring (QoM) for stochastic events. Towards this goal, two closely related research issues need to be addressed. One is how to choose the sensors for charging and decide the charging time for each of them, the other is how to best schedule the sensors' activation schedules according to their received energy. In this paper, we jointly design the charging scheme and sensor schedules to maximize the QoM. We formulate our problem formally as the maximum QoM charging and scheduling problem (MQCSP). Obtaining an exact solution of MQCSP is challenging. Thus we first ignore the MC's travel time and study the resulting relaxed version of MQCSP, R-MQCSP. We show both MQCSP and R-MQCSP are NP-hard. For R-MQCSP, however, under a special condition, we prove that it can be formulated as a sub modular function maximization problem. This formulation allows a 1/6-approximation algorithm for the general case, and a unified algorithm with a series of approximation factors (up to 1-1/e) for a special case. Then, for MQCSP, we propose approximation algorithms by extending our R-MQCSP results. Finally, we conduct extensive trace-driven simulations to validate our algorithm design.

To maximise the capability of these connected entities, trust and reputation among IoT entities is essential. Several trust management models have been proposed in the IoT environment; however, these schemes have not fully addressed the IoT devices’ features, such as device’s role, device type and its dynamic behavior in a smart environment. As a result, traditional trust and reputation models are insufficient to tackle these characteristics and uncertainty risks while connecting nodes to the network. Whilst continuous study has been carried out and various articles suggest promising solutions in constrained environments, research on trust and reputation is still at its infancy. In this paper, we carry out a comprehensive literature review on state-of-the-art research on the trust and reputation of IoT devices and systems. Specifically, we first propose a new structure, namely a new taxonomy, to organise the trust and reputation models based on the ways trust is managed. The proposed taxonomy comprises of traditional trust management-based systems and artificial intelligence-based systems, and combine both the classes which encourage the existing schemes to adapt these emerging concepts. This collaboration between the conventional mathematical and the advanced ML models result in design schemes that are more robust and efficient. Then we drill down to compare and analyse the methods and applications of these systems based on community-accepted performance metrics,e.g. scalability, delay, cooperativeness and efficiency. Finally, built upon the findings of the analysis, we identify and discuss open research issues and challenges, and further speculate and point out future research directions.",none,

Due to IoT, network devices and intelligent machines exchange information through different types of Internet connection and processes are predominantly automated.

Moreover, heterogeneous networks and tremendous devices deployed in the IIoT environment require flexible configuration and reconfiguration according to the change for ensuring dynamic performance. We argue that Software-Defined Networking (SDN) is one of the technologies that can be used to solve some of the previously mentioned issues. In this paper, we propose a survey for the implementation of SDN solutions in IIoT and discuss the pros and cons brought about by this synergy named “SDN-IIoT”. We explore the current articles on SDN-IIoT by considering different crucial domains such as flow installation techniques, fault tolerance, traffic routing optimization, resource management, energy efficiency, real-time, and network security.

Scheduling and power control for energy-optimality of low duty cycled sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1155/2015/432978,1,article,ACM,2015,"The main limitation of operating sensor networks autonomously is the finite battery capacity of sensor nodes. Sensors are usually operated at low duty cycle; that is, they remain in active mode for short duration of time, in order to prolong the network lifetime. However, operating at low duty cycle may result in significant performance degradation in system operation. Hence, in this work, we quantitatively investigate the tradeoff between the duty cyle and network performance. Specifically, we address the design of efficient channel access protocol, by developing a scheduling algorithm based on well known Lyapunov optimization framework. Our proposed policy dynamically schedules transmissions of sensor nodes and their sleep cycles by taking into account the time-varying channel state information, traffic arrivals, and energy consumptions due to switching between operational modes.

Deep optimization algorithm for emergency-aware data transmission in Mobile-Ad Hoc Networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.3233/JIFS-233425,0,research-article,ACM,2023,"Mobile Adhoc Network (MANET) is a dynamic network with mobility nodes.

Multi-path routing confers additional robustness against link failure, but in battery-powered networks it is desirable to choose paths which maximise the overall network lifetime - the time at which a battery is first exhausted. We introduce multi-objective evolutionary algorithms to find the routings which approximate the optimal trade-off between network lifetime and robustness. A novel measure of network robustness, the fragility, is introduced. We show that the distribution of traffic between paths in a given multi-path scheme that optimises lifetime or fragility may be found by solving the appropriate linear program. A multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is used to solve the combinatorial optimisation problem of choosing routings and traffic distributions that give the optimal trade-off between network lifetime and robustness. Efficiency is achieved by pruning the search space using k-shortest paths, braided and edge disjoint paths. The method is demonstrated on synthetic networks and a real network deployed at the Victoria & Albert Museum, London. For these networks, using only two paths per node, we locate routings with lifetimes within 3% of those obtained with unlimited paths per node.

A cyclic MAC scheduler for collecting data from heterogeneous sensors,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.comcom.2011.02.012,1,article,ACM,2011,"Many wireless sensor networks applications, e.g., structural health monitoring (SHM), require the sensors to construct a multihop network to collect the environmental data in real-time. These sensors generally generate sensing data in fixed rates, so their transmission schedules can be deterministically listed. Time division multiple access (TDMA) is especially appropriate for these applications because it can prevent radio interference, thereby reducing the transmission power and maximizing wireless spectrum reuse. However, to reserve sufficient bandwidths on distinct links of a heterogeneous WSN, a complex TDMA schedule is necessary, and a sensor node might need to keep a large TDMA schedule table in its tiny memory. To prevent a large size TDMA schedule table, this paper proposes a CyclicMAC scheduler that assigns each node a temporal transmission pattern which is merely parameterized by period and phase. The CyclicMAC scheduler determines the period to satisfy the bandwidth requirement of the node, and adjusts the phase to achieve collision-freeness and reduce the end-to-end latency as well. The end-to-end latency of the resulting schedule is proven to be optimal if the wireless links only interfere with their parent link and sibling links. As far as we know, CyclicMAC is the first that simultaneously addresses the three design issues of TDMA scheduling, which satisfies heterogeneous bandwidth requirements, minimizing schedule table size, and reducing end-to-end latency, for multihop wireless sensor networks.",none,

Trajectory Matters: Impact of Jamming Attacks Over the Drone Path Planning on the Internet of Drones,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.adhoc.2023.103179,0,research-article,ACM,2023,"The Internet of Drones (IoD) is a network paradigm where drones will fly over well-defined airways. The Jamming Attack (JA) poses a severe risk to IoD, affecting the drone’s trajectory. Although JA has been investigated in UAV-based networks, the current solutions consider the airspace free to fly, whereas IoD allows drones to fly over constrained airspace, named airways. This study investigates the impact of JA over IoD, mainly regarding the drone path planning and, therefore, the drone trajectory. Also, we conduct a thorough discussion regarding the current challenges. To overcome these challenges, we propose the IoD-JAPM, an airway-aware protection mechanism against JA on the IoD, ranging from analyzing the airway’s availability to the potential reformulation of the drone path planning. We perform an experimental evaluation through simulations to compare IoD-JAPM with a baseline solution and an existing approach that considers the airspace free to fly, varying the IoD topology and the number of jammers in the environment. We analyze four different metrics to measure at what level IoD-JAPM can mitigate a JA. Through the results, we observe a relation between the impact of JA on the drone path planning and the robustness of the topology, where the more restricted the topology, the more impact JA causes. Also, IoD-JAPM mitigates the effects of JA on path planning, causing few reformulations or even flight cancellations. Specifically, IoD-JAPM prevents all drones from being attacked when the environment has one jammer and mitigates the attack at 30% for two jammers. Furthermore, IoD-JAPM overcomes the baseline study regarding the increasing drone flight distance, and power consumption. Since the drone propellers affect most of the drone battery, the more the flight distance the more the power consumption. Also, the results reinforce that “free-to-fly” approaches cannot be applied in airway-oriented environments with strong jamming signals. In a nutshell, IoD-JAPM represents a robust protection mechanism against JA considering the aerial space defined through airways, advancing the state of the art of IoD-based protection mechanisms against JA.",none,

This problem is challenging, as serving a data stream in one time slot might enforce serving it at some specific time slots in the future. As a result, most of the existing solutions have relaxed either the periodicity or the demand constraints of the data streams. In contrast, we study the strict enforcement of both requirements through perfectly periodic schedules. We show that the considered problem is NP-hard and address special cases for which optimal schedules can be derived. We further discuss the more generic instance of the problem represented by an arbitrary number of data streams and demands. Specifically, we provide an approximation algorithm and an efficient greedy solution for such a general case of arbitrary weights. We conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed solutions. Finally, we show that it is possible to relax the input demands to improve the communication performance at the cost of some other overhead e.g., in terms of energy consumption.",none,
Data Collection Maximization in Renewable Sensor Networks via Time-Slot Scheduling,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TC.2014.2349521,4,research-article,ACM,2015,"In this paper we study data collection in an energy renewable sensor network for scenarios such as traffic monitoring on busy highways, where sensors are deployed along a predefined path (the highway) and a mobile sink travels along the path to collect data from one-hop sensors periodically. As sensors are powered by renewable energy sources, time-varying characteristics of ambient energy sources poses great challenges in the design of efficient routing protocols for data collection in such networks. In this paper we first formulate a novel data collection maximization problem by adopting multi-rate data transmissions and performing transmission time slot scheduling, and show that the problem is NP-hard. We then devise an offline algorithm with a provable approximation ratio for the problem by exploiting the combinatorial property of the problem, assuming that the harvested energy at each node is given and link communications in the network are reliable. We also extend the proposed algorithm by minor modifications to a general case of the problem where the harvested energy at each sensor is not known in advance and link communications are not reliable. We thirdly develop a fast, scalable online distributed algorithm for the problem in realistic sensor networks in which neither the global knowledge of the network topology nor sensor profiles such as sensor locations and their harvested energy profiles is given. Furthermore, we also consider a special case of the problem where each node has only a fixed transmission power, for which we propose an exact solution to the problem. We finally conduct extensive experiments by simulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms.

Such datasets are usually collected in real-time at the incident scenes using different Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Hierarchical clouds, i.e., core and edge clouds, can help these applications’ real-time data orchestration challenges as well as with their IoT operations scalability, reliability and stability by overcoming infrastructure limitations at the ad-hoc wireless network edge. Routing is a crucial infrastructure management orchestration mechanism for such systems. Current geographic routing or greedy forwarding approaches designed for early wireless ad-hoc networks lack efficient solutions for disaster incident-supporting applications, given the high-speed and low-latency data delivery that edge cloud gateways impose.

Numerous studies on WSNs have been conducted to develop efficient algorithms that can reduce energy consumption and increase the lifetime of the entire network. In this work, the electron orbital topography algorithm is proposed for sensor deployment, which requires a smaller number of sensor nodes to cover a maximum area. In this method, the number of orbitals is estimated based on the degree of criticality of the vulnerable point. The number of sensors in each orbital is then calculated based on electron arrangement theory. After deploying a specific number of sensors in each orbital, the geographical region around the vulnerable point is divided into sectors. From each sector, a sector supervisor is elected based on the maximum residual energy of the node. Then, the cluster supervisor (CS) is selected from a set of sector supervisors located farthest from the most vulnerable point and possessing maximum residual energy. Subsequently, the virtual polygon network is formed by connecting the coordinates of the CS. The centroid of the polygon is calculated to place the sink in an optimal position from all the CS nodes.

In RSUC, unequal clustering and multihop routing are considered, and the “energy holes” problem is alleviated effectively. RSUC includes resource scheduling of intracluster communication and intercluster communication. In resource scheduling of intracluster communication, according to the threshold of the number of cluster members, the cluster heads (CHs) recycle resources of failed nodes. In resource scheduling of intercluster communication, CHs in the different layers based on transmission chain obtain different sending and receiving time slots. In RSUC, CHs that are near the base station (BS) have fewer intracluster communication time slots and more intercluster communication time slots.

Latency-minimizing data aggregation in wireless sensor networks under physical interference model,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.adhoc.2011.12.004,13,article,ACM,2014,"Minimizing latency is of primary importance for data aggregation which is an essential application in wireless sensor networks. Many fast data aggregation algorithms under the protocol interference model have been proposed, but the model falls short of being an accurate abstraction of wireless interferences in reality. In contrast, the physical interference model has been shown to be more realistic and has the potential to increase the network capacity when adopted in a design. It is a challenge to derive a distributed solution to latency-minimizing data aggregation under the physical interference model because of the simple fact that global-scale information to compute the cumulative interference is needed at any node. In this paper, we propose a distributed algorithm that aims to minimize aggregation latency under the physical interference model in wireless sensor networks of arbitrary topologies. The algorithm uses O(K) time slots to complete the aggregation task, where K is the logarithm of the ratio between the lengths of the longest and shortest links in the network. The key idea of our distributed algorithm is to partition the network into cells according to the value K, thus obviating the need for global information. We also give a centralized algorithm which can serve as a benchmark for comparison purposes. It constructs the aggregation tree following the nearest-neighbor criterion. The centralized algorithm takes O( logn) and O(log^3n) time slots when coupled with two existing link scheduling strategies, respectively (where n is the total number of nodes), which represents the current best algorithm for the problem in the literature.

Clustering based routing is the most suitable approach to support for load balancing, fault tolerance, and reliable communication to prolong performance parameters of WSN. These performance parameters are achieved at the cost of reduced lifetime of cluster head (CH).

The key feature of IEEE 802.15.4e TSCH mechanism is to allow the sensors to plan the time-slot schedule for efficient data transmission. However, the standard does not specify how to plan a time-slot schedule so that data collected by the sensors can be received by the base station as soon as possible without being delayed by transmission conflicts. In this paper, we propose a constant-time, distributed time-slot scheduling algorithm to address this problem.

The WSN used in military applications need more security and hence the deployment of trustworthy nodes and links in WSN provides more secure data transmission in Decentralized Military Sensor Networks (DMSNs). Moreover, the DMSNs work with different set of significance constraints including higher security requirements. The design of DMSNs targets surveillance tasks, intruder tracking tasks, army resource maintenance tasks and communication security requirements. Therefore, building a secure and dynamic DMSN against multiple threats is a challenging task. In addition, security principles developed for DMSN cause excessive energy consumption. Moreover, DMSN has completely open distributed architecture without having any base stations. Under this situation, the need for effective and secured data communication can be achieved with the help of a secure routing protocol. Block chains are generally used for making secure financial transactions. However, the routing protocols used in DMSN can support autonomous routing transactions from one node to other node. In this situation, block chain enabled routing procedures can ensure the trustworthiness of any data that is forwarded through different sensor nodes. Hence, a new Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) based Block Chain enabled secured Routing Protocol (GBCRP) is proposed in this paper which authenticates and validates the ongoing routing procedures of DMSN. Moreover, a new intrusion detection system is also proposed in this work using GAN which is deployed in the nodes of the DMSN for enhancing the security of communication. Since block chain based routing protocols do not provide security, the GBCRP works for creating volatile block chains using decentralized authentication principles and effective intrusion detection. The proposed system uses a Fully Decentralized Generative Adversarial Network (FDGAN) for monitoring the secure routing transactions by the development of an intrusion detection system.

There are four main issues in the design of a WSN: determining sensor locations (deployment), scheduling sensors, finding sink locations, and obtaining sensor-to-sink data routes. Sensors have very limited energy resources and their efficient management becomes critical for elongating network lifetime. As a result, most of the works on optimal WSN design are concerned with efficient energy usage. Unfortunately, only a few of them use an integrated approach and try to address these four issues simultaneously. In this work we also follow this line of research and develop first a monolithic mixed-integer linear programming model that maximizes network lifetime by optimally determining sensor and sink locations, sensor-to-sink data flows, active and stand-by periods of the sensors subject to data flow conservation, energy consumption and budget usage constraints. Then we propose a nested solution method consisting of two procedures: simulated annealing that performs search for the best sink locations in the outer level and Lagrangian relaxation based heuristic employed with weighted Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition for the multiplier update in the inner level, which determines sensor locations, activity schedules of the sensors and data flows routes.

Energy management system designed for effective use of harvested energy. Wireless sensor networks (WSN) coupled with EMS and grid-based applications serve as a support for smart home appliances. The integrated system architectures are cost effective and are energy harvesting that is profitable for end-user applications. Identifying optimal devices and defining an energy management policy are a tedious task as the devices are interfaced through different application support. This manuscript proposes a reward-based energy harvesting (REH) approach for identifying reliable devices in order to frame minimal-allocation energy for its operation. The rewards for the devices are estimated through observations carried out using reinforced learning that determines the operation state of the device. The reward function is computed using a variant function evaluated using the enduring energy and storage metrics of a device. Unlike the other learning methods, this approach operates in variable communication interval retaining the reward from the previous history of the devices. With a distributed WSN support and recursive knowledge of the sensor devices, REH is intended to improve the energy conservation rate with lesser retransmissions. The curtailed number of retransmissions minimizes delay with more preferable ideal devices in a home management system. The performance of the proposed REH is evaluated through simulations considering the following metrics: end-to-end delay, energy utilization, packets forwarded, expected TTL and number of retransmissions.",none,

Neural Network Clustering and Swarm Intelligence-Based Routing Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks: A Machine Learning Perspective,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1155/2023/4758852,0,research-article,ACM,2023,"With no requirement for an established network infrastructure, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are well suited for applications that call for quick network deployment. Military training and emergency rescue operations are two prominent uses of WSNs. The individual network nodes must carry out routing and intrusion detection because there is no predetermined routing or intrusion detection in a wireless network. WSNs can only manage a certain volume of data, and doing so requires a significant amount of energy to process, transmit, and receive. Since sensors have a modest energy source and a constrained bandwidth, they cannot transmit all of their data to a base station for processing and analysis. Therefore, machine learning (ML) techniques are needed for WSNs to facilitate data transmission. Other current solutions have drawbacks as well, such as being less reliable, more susceptible to environmental changes, converging more slowly, and having shorter network lifetimes. This study addressed problems with wireless sensor networks and devised an efficient clustering and routing algorithm based on machine learning.

Then, the TCHs compete for final CHs and the optimal CHs are selected using the deer hunting optimization (DHO) algorithm. The DHO based clustering technique derives a fitness function using residual energy, distance to BS, node degree, node centrality, and link quality. To further improve the performance of the proposed method, the cluster maintenance phase is utilized for load balancing. Finally, to achieve security in cluster based WSN, an effective intrusion detection system using a deep belief network is executed on the CHs to identify the presence of intruders in the network. An extensive set of experiments were performed to ensure the superior performance of the proposed method interms of energy efficiency, network lifetime, packet delivery ratio, average delay, and intrusion detection rate.",none,
Mission-based PTR triangle for multi-UAV systems flight planning,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.adhoc.2023.103115,0,article,ACM,2023,"The Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) domain, especially the design of UAV cooperative systems, is one of the most important research and applied fields nowadays. The multi-UAV system design is a wealth of research points under the flight planning umbrella, including the design of communication protocols for the Flying Ad-hoc Network (FANET) connecting UAVs, and the inevitable flight design aspects which are the mission planning and path planning. With the fact that topology and routing are the communication design parts most affected by FANET's highly dynamic 3D movement, this paper introduces a design concept for multi-UAV system flight plan that has been named mission-based PTR triangle to indicate the importance of joint optimization of the three design pillars: Path planning, Topology control, and Routing strategy based on mission requirements. These aspects are very interconnected; they determine the UAV positions and relative placement and how the UAVs are connected; any of them can influence or be influenced by the other. They can be regarded as a single process and the trade-off between their parameters controls their influence. In addition, most of the flight planning operations are confined to a PTR triangle its edges represent cross-layer or joint optimization associations, results in different optimization cases to support adaptive optimality suitable to the dynamic nature of FANET, design constraints, and variety in mission scenarios. To this end, this paper sheds light on and reviews the work done on each process and on the mission analysis, including classifications, approaches, and examples of separate and cross-layered optimization. The paper drew a roadmap for flight planning employing the mission-based PTR triangle design approach with a proof-of-concept to the PTR joint optimization ideas.

BCEWN: Design of a Hybrid Bioinspired Clustering Model for Deployment of Energy-Aware Wireless Networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11277-024-11377-9,0,research-article,ACM,2024,"A low-power wireless network design is an iterative process that integrates multiple optimization techniques to identify and mitigate redundant network operations. Existing power-aware models either showcase higher complexity or require larger information sets, which limits their scalability for real-time networks. Moreover, these models work well under an elaborative set network configuration but cannot be used for general-purpose networks. The study suggests creating a novel hybrid bioinspired clustering model for energy-aware wireless network deployment to address these problems. The proposed model initially collects limited network information sets, including approximate node locations, residual energy levels, temporal throughput, and packet delivery levels. These sets are processed via a Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), which performs initial binary-clustering operations. These binary clusters are generated by iterative identification of high-energy nodes between a given set of source & destination pairs. Results of the clustering process are used to train a Particle Swarm Optimizer (PSO) that uses the temporal information sets to identify energy-aware routing paths. The PSO models a temporal fitness function capable of reducing redundant node selections, thereby improving network lifetime even under many communication requests. Performance of the GWO-clustering & PSO-routing model was validated under large-scale scenarios, and it was observed that the proposed model reduced energy consumption by 8.3% while improving communication speed by 3.2% with a 4.5% higher data rate and 2.9% higher packet delivery performance under real-time heterogeneous network scenarios.",none,

Fuzzy Logic Based Reliable and Real-Time Routing Protocol for Mobile Ad hoc Networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11277-017-4885-9,14,article,ACM,2018,"MANET (mobile ad-hoc network) includes a set of wireless mobile nodes which communicate with one another without any central controls or infrastructures and they can be quickly implemented in the operational environment. One of the most significant issues in MANETs is concerned with finding a secure, safe and short route so that data can be transmitted through it. Although several routing protocols have been introduced for the network, the majority of them just consider the shortest path with the fewest number of hops. Hop criterion is considered for simple implementation and it is reliable in dynamic environments; however, queuing delay and connection delay in the intermediate nodes are not taken into consideration for selecting route in this criterion. In this paper, a fuzzy logic-based reliable routing protocol (FRRP) is proposed for MANETs which selects stable routes using fuzzy logic. It is able to optimize system efficiency. The score allocated to routes are based on four criteria: accessible bandwidth, the amount of energy of battery, the number of hops and the degree of dynamicity of nodes. The simulation results obtained from OPNET simulator version 10.5 indicate that the proposed protocol, in comparison with ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) and fuzzy-based on-demand routing protocol (FBORP), was able to better improve packet delivery rate, average end-to-end delay and throughput.",none,

Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) play an indispensable role to achieve faster communication. Sensors are tiny devices which can store less power and need the power to be retained until final communication. The main need is to achieve routing of the sensors while performing the data transmission should be taken care. Optimal routing technique is necessitated to transfer data from sensors in the clusters and to the central station. The main focus is to dwindle the battery power consumption and increase the network life time.

Latency improvement strategies for reliability-aware scheduling in Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1155/2015/178368,0,article,ACM,2015,"We propose novel strategies for end-to-end reliability-aware scheduling in Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks (IWSNs). Because of stringent reliability requirements in industrial applications where missed packets may have disastrous or lethal consequences, all IWSN communication standards are based on Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA), allowing for deterministic channel access on theMAC layer. We therefore extend an existing generic and scalable reliability-aware scheduling approach by the name of SchedEx. SchedEx has proven to quickly produce TDMA schedules that guarantee a user-defined end-to-end reliability level ρ for all multihop communication in a WSN. Moreover, SchedEx executes orders of magnitude faster than recent algorithms in the literature while producing schedules with competitive latencies. We generalize the original problem formulation from single-channel to multichannel scheduling and propose a scalable integration into the existing SchedEx approach. We further introduce a novel optimal bound that produces TDMA schedules with latencies around 20% shorter than the original SchedEx algorithm. Combining the novel strategies withmultiple sinks, multiple channels, and the introduced optimal bound, we could through simulations verify latency improvements by almost an order of magnitude, reducing the TDMA superframe execution times from tens of seconds to seconds only, which allows for a utilization of SchedEx for many time-critical control applications.",none,
Increasing Aggregation Convergecast Data Collection Frequency through Pipelining,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1155/2018/1539642,0,research-article,ACM,2018,"We consider the problem of increasing the data collection frequency of aggregation convergecast. Previous studies attempt to increase the data collection frequency by shortening the completion of a single data collection cycle. We aim at increasing the frequency at which data collection updates are collected by the use of pipelining and, consequently, increasing the overall data collection frequency and throughput. To achieve this, we overlap the propagation schedule of multiple data snapshots within the same overall schedule cycle, thus increasing parallelism through pipelining. Consequently, the effective data collection time of an individual snapshot may span over multiple, successive, schedule cycles. To this end, we modify the aggregation convergecast model, decoupling schedule length, and data collection delay, by relaxing its precedence constraints. Our solution for this new problem involves the unconventional approach of constructing the schedule before finalizing the exact form of the data aggregation tree, which, in turn, requires that the schedule construction phase guarantees that every node can reach the sink. We compare our results using snapshot pipelining against a previously proposed algorithm that also uses a form of pipelining, as well as against an algorithm that though lacking pipelining, exhibits the ability to produce very short schedules. The results confirm the potential to achieve a substantial throughput increase, at the cost of some increase in latency.",none,

While basic features were successively implemented, more complex ones have been left aside for a new release. Such is the case of RAN slicing, which enables the division of a radio infrastructure into software-controlled logical networks. Among the technical difficulties is the radio resource allocation since slices can be attached to contract agreements with network performance targets, and the number of resources required to support the performance varies with the signal quality of the connected devices. Machine learning solutions can predict the number of radio resources needed based on the current state of the network. Our previous work, KPI-Converter, addressed this issue with densely connected neural networks. However, amid the current global energy crisis, we should focus on more green machine learning solutions that can achieve similar performance with much lower usage of computational resources.

The minimum backlog problem,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.tcs.2015.08.027,5,research-article,ACM,2015,"We study the minimum backlog problem (MBP). This online problem arises, e.g., in the context of sensor networks. We focus on two main variants of MBP.The discrete MBP is a 2-person game played on a graph G = ( V, E ) . The player is initially located at a vertex of the graph. In each time step, the adversary pours a total of one unit of water into cups that are located on the vertices of the graph, arbitrarily distributing the water among the cups. The player then moves from her current vertex to an adjacent vertex and empties the cup at that vertex. The player's objective is to minimize the backlog, i.e., the maximum amount of water in any cup at any time.The geometric MBP is a continuous-time version of the MBP: the cups are points in the two-dimensional plane, the adversary pours water continuously at a constant rate, and the player moves in the plane with unit speed. Again, the player's objective is to minimize the backlog.We show that the competitive ratio of any algorithm for the MBP has a lower bound of ( D ), where D is the diameter of the graph (for the discrete MBP) or the diameter of the point set (for the geometric MBP). Therefore we focus on determining a strategy for the player that guarantees a uniform upper bound on the absolute value of the backlog.For the absolute value of the backlog there is a trivial lower bound of ( D ), and the deamortization analysis of Dietz and Sleator gives an upper bound of O ( D log N ) for N cups. Our main result is a tight upper bound for the geometric MBP: we show that there is a strategy for the player that guarantees a backlog of O ( D ), independently of the number of cups.We also study a localized version of the discrete MBP: the adversary has a location within the graph and must act locally (filling cups) with respect to his position, just as the player acts locally (emptying cups) with respect to her position.

An image classification approach for hole detection in wireless sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11227-021-04276-4,0,research-article,ACM,2022,"Hole detection is a crucial task for monitoring the status of wireless sensor networks (WSN) which often consist of low-capability sensors. Holes can form in WSNs due to the problems during placement of the sensors or power/hardware failure. In these situations, sensing or transmitting data could be affected and can interrupt the normal operation of the WSNs. It may also decrease the lifetime of the network and sensing coverage of the sensors. The problem of hole detection is especially challenging in WSNs since the exact location of the sensors is often unknown. In this paper, we propose a novel hole detection approach called FD-CNN which is based on Force-directed (FD) Algorithm and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). In contrast to existing approaches, FD-CNN is a centralized approach and is able to detect holes from WSNs without relying on the information related to the location of the sensors. The proposed approach also alleviates the problem of high computational complexity in distributed approaches. The proposed approach accepts the network topology of a WSN as an input and generates the identity of the nodes surrounding each detected hole in the network as the final output. In the proposed approach, an FD algorithm is used to generate the layout of the wireless sensor networks followed by the identification of the holes in the layouts using a trained CNN model. In order to prepare labeled datasets for training the CNN model, an unsupervised pre-processing method is also proposed in this paper. After the holes are detected by the CNN model, two algorithms are proposed to identify the regions of the holes and corresponding nodes surrounding the regions. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed approach based on different datasets. Experimental results show that FD-CNN can achieve 80% sensitivity and 93% specificity in less than 2 minutes.",none,

A Dynamic Threat Prevention Framework for Autonomous Vehicle Networks based on Ruin-theoretic Security Risk Assessment,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3660527,0,research-article,ACM,2024,"In recent years, Autonomous Vehicle Networks (AVNs) have gained significant attention for their potential to make transportation safer and more efficient.

Malicious or selfish drivers can potentially intercept, modify, and manipulate V2V communication, causing confusion among vehicles or stealing sensitive data. Therefore, in order to identify and mitigate security threats that could jeopardize V2V communication in AVNs, the implementation of a threat prevention framework is imperative. This paper presents a threat prevention framework that assesses security risks dynamically to facilitate secure message forwarding in V2V communication. First, we propose a dynamic risk assessment technique that utilizes the PIER approach to evaluate the level of security threats posed to V2V communication, and ultimately generate a risk score. Second, we develop a security decay assessment method that utilizes ruin theory to continuously monitor security risk within the AVNs.

Enhancing privacy for ad hoc systems with predeployment key distribution,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.adhoc.2017.01.003,2,research-article,ACM,2017,"Achieving security in distributed systems of constrained devices (like Wireless Sensor Networks) requires methods that can be performed while very limited computational, memory and communication resources are available. Moreover, while designing security protocols one needs take into account the adversary that can eavesdrop communication or compromise some of the devices. To achieve some level of security, two communicating devices need to establish a communication key. In the setting of severely constrained devices traditional methods are infeasible due to resource limitations, and one has to incorporate other security providing methods. One of the first such protocols has been introduced in Eschenauer and Gligor [23]. The paper followed by dozens of others relies on probabilistic key sharing among the nodes before deployment (key predistribution) in the Ad Hoc environment.In our paper, we show that regular protocols of key predistribution designed primarily for providing confidentiality of communication do not provide privacy in many natural scenarios. More precisely, even a weak adversary may link transmissions of the same nodes. In particular even a passive adversary that is eavesdropping the communication can easily recognize whether the same devices start communication several times. Such information not only breaches nodes privacy but also can be a starting point for an more advanced attacks and can give significant information about networks activity. We define several models of adversary and introduce some general methods that can be used for addressing this issue. For the model with weaker adversary we show how to fully secure the privacy in an efficient manner.

The paper presents a well-organized trust estimation-based routing scheme (ETERS) that consists multi-trust (communication trust, energy trust, data trust) approach to alleviate several internal attacks like badmouthing, Sybil, selective forwarding, on–off,​ black hole, and gray-hole attacks for clustered WSN. The proposed multi-trust approach is used to analyze the credibility of sensitive monitored data. A novel and efficient cluster head selection algorithm (ECHSA) is employed to improve the performance of the cluster head (CH) selection process in clustered WSN. ECHSA allows the facility to elect a robust CH after a certain period to perform an equal load balance on all CHs. ETERS utilizes the Beta distribution-based trust function because recovery of trust values under attacks is faster in Beta distribution than Gaussian and Dirichlet distribution. ETERS also incorporates an irregular attenuation factor during the evaluation of communication trust to reflect the effect of various external factors such as natural calamity (earthquake), network congestion, etc., based on the trust values. However, a trust-based attack detection algorithm (TADA) assesses the reliability of SNs to detect internal attacks. TADA employs IDs, locations, and triple trust to detect internal attacks. Additionally, the proposed trust system employs an adjustable dynamic sliding length logical timing window to eradicate the limitations of existing trust models.

We model a large-scale wireless sensor network as a tiered graph relative to its distance from the sink, and introduce the notion of relay graph and relay factor to direct the next-hop candidates toward the sink fairly and efficiently. The sink develops a transmission and reception schedule for the sensor nodes based on the tiered graph search for a set of nodes that can simultaneously transmit and receive. The resulting schedule eventually allows data from each sensor node to be delivered to the sink.

However, most of existing research works study these two issues separately, and neglect the impact of path selection on the satellite power consumption. This paper investigates the joint optimization problem of routing, bandwidth allocation, user association, channel allocation, and power allocation of the STINs. We aim at minimizing satellites’ power consumption while satisfying user's Quality of Service (QoS). Because the power consumption of satellites for routing in the space segment is involved with the data rate through satellite gateways in the user segment, this optimization problem is a Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) problem. To this end, we convert the MOO problem to a Single-Objective Optimization (SOO) problem by linear weighted method.

In this paper, we present a novel cluster scheduling scheme for WSNs using local gravitational method to adaptively determine the number of time-varying clusters based on a sequence of vectors. The main idea in this method is to be inspired by the physical features of gravity force among the mass units. These features are considered to be units of mass of nodes in vector space. It is based on the fact that with clustering, the highest gravitational force on moving the units of mass is applied by the area with feature vectors that are high-density. Cooperative and distributed clustering is formed and the number of clusters is found by sharing the gravitational force between neighboring nodes through a distribution-optimization scheme. The results of this study have been compared with the existing methods in various scenarios and with many performance criteria through the Matlab programming.

Besides, only saturated systems are considered in these protocols, which may imply resources' underutilization in some practical use cases. In this paper, we present an energy-aware TDMA-based link scheduling protocol, named deterministic link scheduling protocol (DLSP), designed with the aim of achieving both low energy consumption and low latency in wireless sensor networks. DLSP takes advantage of the spatial reuse of interference-free time slots using conflict graphs. Unlike earlier studies that often considered saturated traffic, we propose to relax the saturation assumption in order to maintain good performance when some of the nodes have no data to send.

Based on the typical 5G architecture with achievable improvements (beyond-5G), an algorithmic D2D networking investigation is conducted for the wireless networking of ad hoc IoT. According to theoretical analysis and numerical simulation results, it is estimated that the appropriate D2D routing is capable of the reducing of energy consumption level up to 93%.

This paper presents Fuzzy and Ant Colony Optimization Based Combined MAC, Routing, and Unequal Clustering Cross-Layer Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks (FAMACROW) consisting of several nodes that send sensed data to a Master Station. FAMACROW incorporates cluster head selection, clustering, and inter-cluster routing protocols. FAMACROW uses fuzzy logic with residual energy, number of neighboring nodes, and quality of communication link as input variables for cluster head selection.

An energy-efficient data gathering algorithm to prolong lifetime of wireless sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.comcom.2009.11.008,17,article,ACM,2010,"Nodes in most wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are powered by batteries with limited energy. Prolonging network lifetime and saving energy are two critical issues for WSNs. Some energy-saving routing algorithms like minimum spanning tree based ones can reduce total energy consumption of a WSN, but they place too heavy burden of forwarding data packets on several key nodes so that these nodes quickly drain out available battery energy, making network lifetime shortened. In this paper, a routing algorithm termed Energy-efficient Routing Algorithm to Prolong Lifetime (ERAPL) is proposed, which is able to dramatically prolong network lifetime while efficiently expends energy. In the ERAPL, a data gathering sequence (DGS), used to avoid mutual transmission and loop transmission among nodes, is constructed, and each node proportionally transmits traffic to the links confined in the DGS. In addition, a mathematical programming model, in which minimal remaining energy of nodes and total energy consumption are included, is presented to optimize network lifetime. Moreover, genetic algorithms are used to find the optimal solution of the proposed programming problem. Further, simulation experiments are conducted to compare the ERAPL with some well-known routing algorithms and simulation results show the ERAPL outperforms them in terms of network lifetime.",none,

Multi-objective Node Placement Considering Non-uniform Event Pattern,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11277-017-4834-7,1,article,ACM,2017,"Ease of use, high flexibility and variety of applications have made wireless sensor networks very popular. Node placement in a sensor network is very critical since it affects important network attributes such as coverage, lifetime, and reliability. Therefore, controlled node placement is necessary for achieving specific network features with minimum number of nodes. Since node placement is an NP-hard problem, many placement algorithms have been proposed based on heuristic and meta-heuristic methods. Most of those algorithms assume a uniform event pattern (UEP) throughout the area under investigation. However, in practice some networks deal with non-uniform event pattern (NEP). Optimization of one attribute of the network usually results in degradation of other attributes. That is why in recent studies multi-objective optimization methods have been used which usually provide a set of best answers while the final answer is selected by a decision maker applying a trade-off between all attributes. In this paper a method for controlled node placement is proposed based on multi-objective optimization (MOO) algorithms considering a non-uniform event pattern for the network (NPNEP). In that sense this method is an extension of the previous methods that use uniform event pattern. Because of the good performance of multi-objective optimization evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition (MOEA/D), it is utilized as the optimization tool in node placement. In order to use MOEA/D, a few objective functions are defined which can optimize important attributes like coverage, power consumption, delay, reliability and lifetime. In order to achieve optimal node utilization, load balance, and increased lifetime, a cost function for routing is proposed as well as a data gathering and reporting method which both help increase the lifetime of a network. The proposed method can be used for wireless sensor networks with heterogeneous nodes. This algorithm can be used in initial deployment phase as well as operation phase or when problems like fragmentation or loss of coverage occurs. The result of NPNEP algorithm is the initial position of nodes or position of the new nodes which provide the best answers in MOO algorithm. Performance of the proposed algorithm and the effect of NEP as opposed to UEP have been verified by simulations.",none,

This paper reviews the extent to which research in economic infrastructure sectors has engaged with fields of AI, to investigate the specific AI methods chosen and the purposes to which they have been applied both within and across sectors. Machine learning is found to dominate the research in this field, with methods such as artificial neural networks, support vector machines, and random forests among the most popular. The automated reasoning technique of fuzzy logic has also seen widespread use, due to its ability to incorporate uncertainties in input variables.

An adaptive trust system for misbehavior detection in wireless sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11276-024-03687-4,0,research-article,ACM,2024,"Trust management has been shown to be an effective technique for protecting networks from malicious nodes and ensuring wireless sensor network (WSN) security. A number of trust systems have been proposed, but most of them are not adaptative to the current state of network security and the intensity of the attacks to which they are subjected, especially in the case of collaborative attacks. They employ fixed trust metrics derived from expert opinion rather than the objective method based on the network’s current security level. Furthermore, they are complex trust systems designed for a specific application with a high attack probability. Thus, even with a low attack rate, they consume a lot of energy. This paper proposes an adaptive trust system that considers both the network’s risk level and the trust values of sensor nodes at the same time. To match the situation in the network, the proposed system employs various trust policies. In risky situations where the WSN environment remains untrustworthy, the proposed system adjusts its trust metrics based on the network attack intensity. When the attacks are eliminated and the misbehavior rate is low, the system switches to an energy efficient policy and adjusts its trust metrics to conserve sensor node energy. Simulation results show that a zero-tolerance policy achieves 95% of the detection rate and conserves 50% of nodes’ energy under the presence of 35% of malicious nodes in the network. Energy efficient policy achieves 90% of detection rate and conserves 95% of nodes’ energy under the existence of 10% of malicious nodes in the network. Normal policy achieves up to 90% of detection rate between 15 and 25% of malicious nodes while conserving 70% and 80% of energy under these percentages.",none,
An efficient algorithm for scheduling sensor data collection through multi-path routing structures,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.jnca.2013.03.013,3,article,ACM,2014,"Multi-path routing is essential to improve the robustness of sensor data collection in error-prone wireless communication environments. Besides the robustness against communication failures, both the energy efficiency and time efficiency are also of primary importance in sensor data collection due to the limited energy supplies of sensor nodes and the real-time nature of sensor network applications. Contention-free time division multiple access (TDMA) protocols have the potential to reduce the energy consumption and the latency of sensor data collection. To collect sensor data using a TDMA protocol, sensor nodes need to be assigned appropriate time slots for transmitting and receiving data prior to the data collection process. We note that the distributed TDMA scheduling process for sensor data collection incurs overhead costs of energy consumption and time latency. However, these overhead costs are usually overlooked, especially when multi-path routing is used to collect sensor data. In this paper, we propose an efficient scheduling algorithm for data collection through multi-path routing structures in wireless sensor networks. The objective of our scheduling algorithm is to reduce both the message complexity and running time of the scheduling process as much as possible. In addition, we also develop a method for deriving a lower bound on the shortest possible length of the data collection schedule that can be generated by any algorithm. The lower bound latency estimation offers a practical method to evaluate the efficiency of data collection schedules produced by scheduling algorithms. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed scheduling algorithm significantly reduces the number of messages transmitted during the scheduling process and the running time compared to an existing scheduling algorithm. The length of the data collection schedule produced by our algorithm is normally within 1.9 times of the lower bound estimate across a wide range of network settings.",none,

An optimal cluster formation based energy efficient dynamic scheduling hybrid MAC protocol for heavy traffic load in wireless sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.cose.2018.04.009,30,research-article,ACM,2018,"This article proposes an Energy Efficient Dynamic Scheduling Hybrid MAC Protocol (EDS-MAC) for Traffic Adaptive Wireless Sensor Networks. The proposed approach consists of two stages. (i) cluster formation, and (ii) data transmission. In the first stage, a variable step size firefly algorithm (VSSFFA) is proposed for generating energy-aware clusters by optimal selection of cluster heads. The VSSFFA reduces the cost of locating optimal position for the head nodes in a cluster. Additionally, we proposed the VSSFFA-based approach within the cluster rather than base station, which makes it a semi-distributed method. The selection criteria of the objective function are based on the residual energy, intra-cluster distance, node degree and head count of the probable cluster heads. Data communication is done using data transmission stage, which reduces the latency, delay, and control overhead. Compared to IH-MAC, EDS-MAC reduces the size of control packet by introducing short node address (1 byte instead of 8 bytes in IH-MAC). By enabling lower duty cycle operation and by performing efficient clustering, it reduces overhearing and reduces the overall latency experienced by the sensor network. Hence, introduction of EDS-MAC protocol in WSN can help the users with prolonged network life span and minimize the energy and overhead utilization of the overall network. The efficiency of the proposed MAC protocol has been analyzed using the NS-2 simulator. WSN employing EDS-MAC is compared with IH-MAC and is found to experience 50% reduction in overall energy consumption and 72% reduction in overall delay experienced by the network.",none,

An efficient Markov energy predictor for software defined wireless sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11276-022-03058-x,0,research-article,ACM,2022,"Software-defined wireless sensor networks (SDWSNs) are a great step forward to centralize and facilitate the management of low-power networks. However, the continuous sending of local information from the sensor nodes to the controller causes excessive energy loss and increases the network overhead. This dilemma has become one of the hot topics of current research to make SDWSNs more efficient. This paper has proposed an efficient energy predictor for SDWSNs (E2-SDWSN) to improve the performance of the sensor network. The proposed approach reduces the cost of packet delivery and energy consumption using the well-known MapReduce framework with an intelligent selection of the reducers. Using MapReduce in the SDWSN by in-network processing significantly reduces energy consumption and balances traffic. Furthermore, the controller using an energy prediction model predicts the residual energy level of the nodes. Therefore, assuming the position of the nodes is fixed, the need to sequential send local packets is reduced. Reducing the number of local and energy information packets of the network decreases the network traffic. This consequently improves the quality of service and reduces energy consumption. Therefore, the proposed model increases the lifetime of the network.

CAIN: An energy-aware and intelligent increasing coverage area routing protocol for future 6G networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.comnet.2023.109733,0,research-article,ACM,2023,"More devices are being introduced to the cellular network every day, and it is time to think about how the next generation will deal with them. The 6G will bring new ways to think about how to share information and will not rely just on communication with a fixed Base Station (BS). A post-disaster scenario may damage the network infrastructure; the devices need to create an ad-hoc network to communicate in this situation. The ad-hoc network must achieve some of the 6G’s requirements, such as communication frequency, data rate, and latency, to communicate with the 6G networks when available. The increase in the frequency used to achieve such data rate has the downside of decreasing the signal range, i.e., for two nodes to communicate, they must be closer to each other. Academia is developing alternatives to increase the network coverage area, allowing devices to further the ad-hoc Access Point (AP) to overcome this drawback. Thus, with this work, we propose CAIN, an 6G routing protocol that uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to increase the network coverage area. Depending on the node’s connectivity to an AP, i.e., if the node is connected to an AP or not, CAIN uses different messages to make nodes further the AP to communicate with it, increasing the network coverage area. Hence, if there is no connected node to an AP, it chooses a neighbor with a connection to one to forward the message. Also, if there is no connected neighbor to an AP, the node chooses a neighbor to flood the message until it reaches an AP. To improve its performance, we enhance CAIN with AI techniques, such as Reinforcement Learning (RL), Federated Learning (FL), and Deep Neural Network (DNN). These techniques allow the node to make a better neighbor choice and increase the network coverage area even more. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that proposes a routing protocol for the 6G scenario that uses RL techniques with FL and DNN to increase the network coverage.

PRIN: A Priority-Based Energy Efficient MAC Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks Varying the Sample Inter-Arrival Time,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11277-016-3581-5,7,article,ACM,2017,"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are used in a variety of applications to sense and transfer information to the centralized node with energy efficiency increasing the network's lifespan.

A guide for the selection of routing protocols in WBAN for healthcare applications,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1186/s13673-017-0105-6,6,article,ACM,2017,"In the present scenario, the term wireless body area network (WBAN) is becoming an integral part of human day to day life due its wide variety of applications, especially in the field of healthcare systems. To design such a reliable body area network system, there are a number of factors to be considered both in hardware and software levels. One of such factors still developing is the design and the analysis of routing protocols in the network layer. Routing protocols are a set of protocols which can identify and maintain the routes in the network so that the data can be exchanged between the nodes efficiently. Hence, routing protocol plays a vital role in the wireless sensor networks for reliable communication between the sensor nodes. In this paper, different routing protocols for body area networks are surveyed and observed that they are affected by factors like energy, network topology, various quality of services (QoS) in the nodes, node temperature, transmission range of nodes, human posture, etc. An evocative taxonomy of protocols is presented such as cluster-based, cross-layered, postural movement based, QoS aware and temperature-aware routing protocols. From the survey, it is found that the selection of a routing protocol is application dependent. For example, the energy efficient protocols like reinforcement learning based routing with QoS support or wireless autonomous spanning tree protocol can be used for daily health monitoring systems due to its high packet delivery ratio. If the system is for in vivo networks, routing algorithm for network of homogeneous and Id-less biomedical sensor nodes or mobility-supporting adaptive threshold-based Thermal-aware energy-efficient multi-hop protocols are the suitable ones. For critical and emergency cases, where accuracy with little delay is the major concern, the protocols like critical data routing, reliability aware routing, data-centric multi objective QoS-aware routing protocol, etc. can be rightly chosen.

The communication paradigm is changing and new approach related to machine learning or other optimization algorithms are being introduce rapidly. The TCP/IP or OSI model is not at all equipped to accommodate such a vast changes in its established protocol stacks. Considering this, we have proposed the hybrid cross layer design where the communication or transmission will be handle using two set of protocol stack. One set for the established classical network, and another using cross layer approach. Our design leverages the strengths of both the physical and MAC layers to optimize packet transmission and minimize energy consumption. An optimization algorithm based on gradient descent is also developed to adjust transmission parameters in real-time. The objective is to invoke the classical model only when it needed; it means until unless gradient descent is able to make classification regarding the node scheduling and achieve the acknowledgment, the TCP/IP protocol stack will be in deactivation. Using this method, we have performed our experiments mainly on two parameters named as packet delivery ratio (PDR), end-to-end delay (E2ED); because these are important aspect of reliability. In addition to that, the energy consumption of network is also compared with the existing algorithms. The results show that the proposed hybrid cross-layer design outperforms the existing algorithms. The performance gain can be attributed to the cross-layer approach and the use of the optimization algorithm.

ENROUTE: An Entropy Aware Routing Scheme for Information-Centric Networks (ICN),https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11277-021-08944-9,0,research-article,ACM,2022,"With the exponential growth of end users and web data, the internet is undergoing the change of paradigm from a user-centric model to a content-centric one, popularly known as information-centric networks (ICN). Current ICN research evolves around three key-issues namely (i) content request searching, (ii) content routing, and (iii) in-network caching scheme to deliver the requested content to the end user. This would improve the user experience to obtain requested content because it lowers the download delay and provides higher throughput. Existing researches have mainly focused on on-path congestion or expected delivery time of a content to determine the optimized path towards custodian. However, it ignores the cumulative effect of the link-state parameters and the state of the cache, and consequently it leads to degrade the delay performance. In order to overcome this shortfall, we consider both the congestion of a link and the state of on-path caches to determine the best possible routes. We introduce a generic term entropy to quantify the effects of link congestion and state of on-path caches. Thereafter, we develop a novel entropy dependent algorithm namely ENROUTE for searching of content request triggered by any user, routing of this content, and caching for the delivery this requested content to the user. The entropy value of an intra-domain node indicates how many popular contents are already cached in the node, which, in turn, signifies the degree of enrichment of that node with the popular contents. On the other hand, the entropy for a link indicates how much the link is congested with the traversal of contents. In order to have reduced delay, we enhance the entropy of caches in nodes, and also use path with low entropy for downloading contents. We evaluate the performance of our proposed ENROUTE algorithm against state-of-the-art schemes for various network parameters and observe an improvement of 29–52% in delay, 12–39% in hit rate, and 4–39% in throughput.",none,

It is easy to cause the coordinates of underwater nodes drift affected by water flow action. Some sparsely deployed underwater nodes may form coverage holes, which makes it impossible to locate underwater targets effectively. Combined with the water flow situation, this paper proposes an improved brain storm optimization integrated with virtual force algorithm (IBSO-VFA) for improving UWSN coverage performance. After analyzing the water jet model and the resultant force along Z axis, the velocity components of east, north and depth directions can be derived, which can reveal the coordinate evolution model of drifted underwater nodes under water flow action. Underwater nodes present non-uniform distribution of partly sparse and partly dense coverage, even with a lot of coverage holes. Inspired by the virtual force algorithm, the drifted underwater nodes are driven to their relative communicable positions. Meanwhile, the brain storm optimization has been improved and applied to avoid falling into local coverage optimum by pure VFA. Based on the node maximum coverage, the dual mapping of signal domain and localizability domain is established in consideration of ranging and coordinate errors. Finally, a comprehensive performance test is conducted to evaluate IBSO-VFA performance in terms of coverage rates, k-coverage and localizability area. The results indicate that the IBSO-VFA can maximize the UWSN coverage and localizability performance.

In the recent diffusion Gauss-Newton algorithm, the main difficulty is the computation of inverse because the approximated Hessian is not always full column rank. To address this problem, we propose that two methods can be used to approximate the inverse matrix, i.e., Levenberg-Marquardt parameter and Moore-Penrose inverse methods. The former in essence is a damped iteration method, while the latter depends largely on the adjustment of step size. In addition to proposing the methods above for diffusion Gauss-Newton algorithm, we also compare their performance to solve the collaborative localization in wireless sensor networks, which can be modeled as a NLLS problem.

A sensor network is an autonomous self-resource constraint collection of internet of things (IoT) sensor nodes. The nodes communicate in an ad-hoc fashion to transfer cloud information over the virtual environment. Clustering in WSNs helps to improve the quality of the network by controlling energy consumption and improving data gathering accuracy. This improves the service rates of CIoT. Optimizing IoT sensor networks through energy and overhead management requires complex clustering algorithms. A simple clustering scheme cannot achieve the desired performance enhancement during transmission in a virtual environment. This research attempts to propose a reinforcement-based learning technique, adaptive Q-learning (AQL) to improve network performance with minimum energy–overhead tradeoff in a sensor network-aided CIoT. AQL operates in two distinct phases for cluster head selection and forwarder selection. The decision-making system is used to qualify nodes based on their past behavior over transmission. AQL improves both inter- and intra-cluster communication optimization through adaptive forwarder and header selection conditions. The simulation results prove the consistency of the proposed AQL by retaining the live node counts in the network and their persistent energy despite the reduced overheads in the sensor network.

The approaches are systematically classified into four (4) aspects: energy awareness, concurrent access and duty cycle regulations, routing protocols, and security. The first aspect encompasses parameter selection, distance, and clustering. The second aspect focuses on network segregation and time synchronisation. The third aspect covers proactive, reactive, and hybrid routing protocols. The aspect of security includes privacy and Denial-of-Service (DoS). Findings show a consensus that multi-hop networks and adherence to radio duty cycle are able to lower average power consumption.

In such systems, most of the energy is consumed when the radios are on, waiting for a packet to arrive. Sleep-wake scheduling is an effective mechanism to prolong the lifetime of these energy-constrained wireless sensor networks. However, sleep-wake scheduling could result in substantial delays because a transmitting node needs to wait for its next-hop relay node to wake up. An interesting line of work attempts to reduce these delays by developing ""anycast""-based packet forwarding schemes, where each node opportunistically forwards a packet to the first neighboring node that wakes up among multiple candidate nodes. In this paper, we first study how to optimize the anycast forwarding schemes for minimizing the expected packet-delivery delays from the sensor nodes to the sink.

A survey on opportunistic routing protocols in the Internet of Underwater Things,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.comnet.2023.109658,0,article,ACM,2023,"Compared with traditional ocean monitoring technologies, such as cable seabed observation networks, the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) can provide real-time underwater environment monitoring and improve efficiency of data collection.

Taking advantage of the broadcast characteristic of wireless underwater communication, opportunistic routing selects a group of suitable neighbors as potential forwarders instead of selecting only one or a few specific next-hop nodes as in conventional routing, thus improving the success rate of data packet delivery. Critical to routing performance is which nodes participate in data forwarding as forwarders. The nodes act as forwarders are determined by user-defined routing parameters, which are referred to as route metrics in this paper. First, route metrics of opportunistic routing are analyzed and a comprehensive classification of opportunistic routing protocols is discussed based on the route metrics. Then, opportunistic routing protocols for IoUT are further investigated and compared in terms of the adopted communication technique, data delivery ratio, transmission delay efficiency, energy efficiency, buffer efficiency, reliability, etc. Based on the comprehensive classification and comparison, existing problems and future research issues regarding opportunistic routing in IoUT are finally presented.",none,
EACH: Efficient Deployment of Sensor Nodes and Arrangement of Cluster Heads in Hexagon-based WSNs,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3387168.3387217,0,research-article,ACM,2020,"A wireless sensor network (WSN) consists of sensor nodes (SNs) with sensing, computation and wireless communication capabilities. One of the major challenges in designing a well-connected WSN is the coverage of the sensing field, which are depends on various factors (e.g., the sensing model, network topology, and deployment strategy). There are, in general, two types of deployment methods in WSNs, which are random deployment and deterministic deployment. Random deployment of the sensor nodes can cause unbalanced traffic pattern in WSNs. That is, cluster heads (CHs) around the sink have larger load than those farther away from the sink. Hence, CHs close to the sink exhaust their energy earlier. To overcome this problem, we, for the first time, propose an Efficient deployment of sensor nodes and Arrangement of Cluster Heads in hexagon-based WSNs (called ""EACH""). Simulation results validate our theoretical analysis and show that the EACH scheme achieves satisfactory coverage ratio, significantly balances the energy consumption among SNs, and extends network lifetime. The methodology can also be exploited to further analyze and compare deterministic deployment strategies.",none,
A novel technique with overhead in Multi-Path Network Aggregation by Machine Learning Framework (MPAA-MLF),https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11276-023-03364-y,0,research-article,ACM,2023,"Wireless Sensor Networks consist of a collection of nodes that transmit data from source to destination to make effective communication. The transmission is initiated by several routing protocols, which help to identify the optimal route to reach the destination. However, the existing researchers face overhead issues such as delay, transmission reliability, bandwidth, and residual energy. The network overhead difficulties reduce the packet delivery ratio, throughput and maximize the packet drop rate. The research issues are overcome by applying the Multi-Path Network Aggregation by Machine Learning Framework. This algorithm is used on the 500*500 simulation region, and every node is examined in terms of residual energy, transmission rate, and distance. These factors were examined using the Monti consensus clustering and fuzzy inference machine learning system. The consensus algorithm identifies the cluster head, and fuzzy rules are utilized to select the supercluster heads. In addition, the candidate nodes are selected to form the cluster, which helps to transmit the data from source to destination. The vector function and probability value are computed to identify the network aggregated multipaths. This process reduces the transmission delay and improves the overall network performance.

The proper selection of NC coefficients and measurement matrix is investigated for this scheme. This design ensures successful reconstruction of original data with a considerably high probability and enables successful deployment of NC and CS in a real field. Moreover, in contrast to other spatio-temporal schemes with the same computational complexity, the proposed scheme possesses lower reconstruction error by employing independent encoding in each sensor node (including the cluster head nodes) and joint decoding in the sink node. In order to further reduce the reconstruction error, we construct a new optimization model of reconstruction error for the clustered spatio-temporal compression scheme.

Aiming at the ubiquitous positioning accuracy and resource allocation problems in the node positioning, we propose an improved Chaotic Particle Swarm Optimization Hybrid Distance Vector Hopping Algorithm Based on Differential Evolution (DECPSOHDV-Hop) algorithm. This algorithm uses an improved algorithm parallel mechanism in the WSN node positioning, which can be more accurately positioned unknown node through dynamic optimization.

Burst-Aware Time-Triggered Flow Scheduling With Enhanced Multi-CQF in Time-Sensitive Networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TNET.2023.3264583,3,research-article,ACM,2023,"Deterministic transmission guarantee in time-sensitive networks (TSN) relies on queue models (such as CQF, TAS, ATS) and resource scheduling algorithms. Thanks to its ease of use, the CQF queue model has been widely adopted. However, the existing resource scheduling algorithms of CQF model only focus on periodic time-triggered (TT) flows without consideration of bursting flows. Considering that the bursting flows often carry high-priority data in real systems, in this paper we investigate the mixed-flow (i.e., TT and bursting flows) scheduling problem in CQF-based TSN aiming to maximize the number of schedulable flows and system load balance while satisfying the deterministic demands of delay, jitter, and reliability for both TT and bursting flows. Unfortunately, it is challenging to schedule the mixed flows with the original CQF model because of the huge difference between TT and bursting flows. To resolve this problem, we firstly design an enhanced Multi-CQF model to satisfy the basic demands of bursting flows sent at any time without affecting the deterministic transmission of TT flows. Given the complexity of mixed-flow scheduling and the proposed queue model, it is difficult for traditional algorithms to fully utilize network resources. Thus, we further propose a uline time-correlated uline DRL uline resource uline scheduling (TimeDRS) algorithm to optimize the resource allocation. TimeDRS can be extended to other time-related resource scheduling scenarios, such as TDMA-based scheduling.

The approaches that assume frame unicity to satisfy a given set of packets minimize the end-to-end delay. However, they do not guarantee a maximum packet delivery rate due to the difficulty of establishing robust paths for packet transfer across nodes deployed in the network, especially in a three-dimensional (3D) environment. The objective is to minimize the end-to-end delay by ensuring the maximum delivery of packets to their destinations. Furthermore, the signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio (SINR) model is considered to optimize transmission scheduling. In this paper, an optimal node coordinates optimization approach is proposed to extend two recently investigated schemes in the literature (S-RDSP and I-RDSP). The developed algorithms, named S-MPDR and I-MPDR, seek to reduce the end-to-end delay by delivering a collection of inserted packets over a 3D environment while also maximizing the delivery rate of these packets.

In SALA each node in the network is equipped with a set of learning automata. The learning automata residing in each node try to learn the maximum sleep duration for the node in such a way that the detection rate of target points by the node does not degrade dramatically. This is done using the information obtained about the movement patterns of target points while passing throughout the sensing region of the nodes.

A query of this type continuously collects a list of k highest sensor readings into the base station in every epoch and reports to the user. So far, algorithms proposed to process these queries conventionally assume that k is a fixed number and then try to reduce the energy consumption of the sensor nodes or to maximize the lifetime of the network. However, in many practical monitoring applications, the most important user requirement is that the network can collect sensor data effectively for at least a designated amount of time while the value of k can be changed flexibly and only needs to be as high as possible. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an adaptive algorithm to process CTKDC queries in lifetime-constrained wireless sensor networks. Our algorithm works proactively at the sensor nodes and guides each sensor node to compute adaptively the amount of sensor data that it should send to the base station in each sampling interval. By controlling carefully the amounts of sensor data sent, and thus the cost of message transmissions, all sensor nodes together both make sure that the network will run until when the lifetime constraint is satisfied, and maximize the amount of top-k data reported to the user. Through experimental results, we show that the proposed algorithm can effectively ensure the network lifetime requirements when processing CTKDC queries. Moreover, the average amount of top-k data collected by this algorithm in a sampling interval is very close to the one obtained by the offline optimal algorithm in which all sensor readings are assumed to be known a priori.",none,

This paper presents Antilizer, a lightweight, fully-distributed solution to enable WSNs to detect and recover from common network level attack scenarios. In Antilizer each sensor node builds a self-referenced trust model of its neighbourhood using network overhearing. The node uses the trust model to autonomously adapt its communication decisions. In the case of a network attack, a node can make neighbour collaboration routing decisions to avoid affected regions of the network. Mobile agents further bound the damage caused by attacks. These agents enable a simple notification scheme which propagates collaborative decisions from the nodes to the base station. A filtering mechanism at the base station further validates the authenticity of the information shared by mobile agents. We evaluate Antilizer in simulation against several routing attacks.

Computer-aided cluster formation in wireless sensor networks using machine learning,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.3233/JIFS-223242,0,research-article,ACM,2023,"There is a widespread use of cluster-based routing in wireless sensor networks since it is the most energy-efficient. Idealizing cluster heads, on the other hand, is NP-hard and hence requires heuristic or metaheuristic approaches. However, while outperforming algorithms, metaheuristics computation time restricts its ability to respond to routing requests as rapidly as algorithms can today. A network’s or an application’s parameters can’t be easily accommodated by routing methods. This paper offers the HMML, a combination model combining hybrid metaheuristics and machine-learning. Our HMML model makes use of an automated tuning metaheuristic (e.g. evolutionary algorithm) to fine-tune the heuristic technique for each specific configuration. For a variety of combinations, this is done. A network simulation is run using the modified heuristic algorithm in each configuration to arrive at a solution. As a result, a comprehensive dataset for a variety of conditions is produced (e.g., support vector machine). These characteristics include local (round-state), global (network-state), and application-specific aspects of the input feature vector. After training, the HMML model may be used to quickly cluster data. Machine learning’s capacity to generalize helps us comprehend the metaheuristic algorithm’s behavior in identifying optimal paths for previous configurations. Simulation studies show that HMML can adapt to varied applications while extending network life which increases upto 5% for total energy consumption.",none,

Each target sensor is associated with a handling time and each dispatched data mule must return to the depot before time span D. Our main contribution is as follows. First, we give the first constant-factor 2-approximation algorithm and a bicriteria polynomial time approximation scheme (PTAS) for the DMSTC defined on a tree. The former result resolves an open problem proposed in the literature (Chen et al., 2020 [4]).

This paper proposes a novel approach to solve them simultaneously in order to increase the network lifetime. In the proposed scheme, the cluster head’s role in transmitting the inter-cluster traffic is considered during the cluster head selection process. In other words, cluster heads are selected in a way which reduces the energy consumption for transmitting data from a cluster head to the sink node. To achieve this goal, the genetic algorithm is used in two levels. The first-level genetic algorithm selects the cluster heads while the second-level one considers multi-hop routing among them.

First, in UASN, the distance between the nodes changes due to their mobility with the water current, thus increasing the network’s energy consumption. Second problem in UASNs is the occurrence of the void hole, which affects the network’s performance. Because nodes are unable to deliver data towards the destination due to the absence of forwarder nodes (FNs) in the network. Thus, the objective of routing in UASNs is to overcome the issues mentioned earlier to prolong the network’s lifetime. Therefore, a Q-learning based energy-efficient and balanced data gathering (QL-EEBDG) routing protocol is proposed in this paper. In QL-EEBDG, the FNs are selected according to their residual energy and grouped according to their neighboring nodes’ energies. Using energy as the main selection parameter assures efficient energy consumption in the network. Moreover, efficient selection of the FNs increases the lifetime of the network. However, the void node recovery process fails when the topology of the network is changed. Therefore, to avoid void holes in QL-EEBDG, a QL-EEBDG adjacent node (QL-EEBDG-ADN) scheme is proposed.

In this paper, a Combined model based on Metaheuristics and Machine Learning, named CMML, is proposed to support efficient and adaptable routing in clustered wireless sensor networks. In our CMML model, a multi-criteria heuristic clustering algorithm is used for clustering in which a metaheuristic (e.g., genetic algorithm) is utilized for the automatic tuning of the heuristic algorithm for each configuration separately. We repeat this process for several configurations (i.e., for different network sizes, numbers of nodes, aggregation factors, lifetime definitions, etc.). The tuned heuristic algorithm in each configuration is subsequently used for network simulation to obtain the corresponding solution. As a result, a comprehensive dataset for different configurations is derived, which is used to train a machine learning model (e.g., support vector machine). The input feature vector of a sample comprises local features (current state of a node at a round), global features (current state of the network), and application-specific features, while the output is the priority factor of each node to be selected as a cluster head. After training the CMML model, it can be applied as a quickly adaptable clustering protocol. In fact, our motivation is to utilize the generalizability of machine learning to learn the behavioral pattern of the metaheuristic algorithm in finding best routes for previous configurations. Simulation results demonstrate that the CMML model can effectively adapt with different applications, while prolonging the network lifetime based on the application requirements.Highlights•A combined metaheuristic-machine learning technique (named CMML) is presented.•The CMML considers local features, global features, and application features.•The objective function of the metaheuristic algorithm is defined based on the application specifications.•The CMML is evaluated on the test WSNs to justify the performance of the trained CMML model.•The trained CMML model can be applied for online clustering in new unseen WSNs.",none,

One way is to schedule the activities of sensor nodes and form scheduling rounds autonomously in such a way that each spatial point is covered by at least one sensor node and there must be at least one communication path from the sensor nodes to base station. This autonomous activity scheduling of the sensor nodes can be efficiently done with Reinforcement Learning (RL), a technique of machine learning because it does not require prior environment modeling.

In this paper, an enhanced mobility routing protocol for wireless sensor network (EM-RPL) that incorporates modules to support the mobility of nodes has been proposed. The main goal of the EM-RPL is to increase network reliability and efficiency by selecting a route that is more stable and reduces the frequency of route discovery process.

A signal reconstruction method of wireless sensor network based on compressed sensing,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1186/s13638-020-01724-2,1,research-article,ACM,2020,"Compressed sensing (CS) is a new theory for sampling and recovering signal-based sparse transformation. This theory could help us to acquire complete signal at low cost. Therefore, it also satisfies the requirement of low-cost sampling since bandwidth and capability of sampling is not sufficient. However, wireless sensor network is an open scene, and signal is easily affected by noise in the open environment. Specially, CS theory indicates a method of sub-Nyquist sampling which is effective to reduce cost in the process of data acquirement. However, the sampling is “imperfect”, and the corresponding data is more sensitive to noise. Consequently, it is urgently requisited for robust and antinoise reconstruction algorithms which can ensure the accuracy of signal reconstruction. In the article, we present a proximal gradient algorithm (PRG) to reconstruct sub-Nyquist sampling signal in the noise environment. This algorithm iteratively uses a straightforward shrinkage step to find the optimum solution of constrained formula, and then restores the original signal.

Development of WSNs face challenges in sensor designs, communication latencies, and security. SNs have limitations in data storages, processing powers, energy managements, transmissions and security. Data is vulnerable when SNs are compromised. This work proposes SEAMHR (Secure Energy-Aware Meta-Heuristic Routing) protocol for WSNs with the aim to improve security and network performance. The proposed protocol initially uses Meta-Heuristic analysis based on MEHO (Mutation Elephant Herding Optimization) to achieve a trustworthy and intelligent learning. The protocol uses hop counts, link integrity parameters, and aggregated residual energy to learn the routing decisions. Counter Mode Cryptography method is also used by the protocol using AEs (Auto encoders) called CTR-AEDL for securing data with encryptions and authenticates inter-routing to increase the algorithm's security. Improved and secure data transmissions are achieved by CTR-AEDL which generates keys using five essential components: secret keys, counter bits, data packets, classifier's weights and biases. The encryption method generates four-factor unique patterns for counter blocks, and cipher texts are generated by softmax operations between data packets and counter blocks. The actual data packets are obtained using decryptions with the same key. In addition, traffic explorations reduce link failures and network disconnections as part of route maintenance strategies.

Discrete nodes perform reinforcement learning during the interaction with their neighboring nodes. Simultaneously, the neural networks that fit the V values guide the underlying nodes’ learning. Second, the algorithm divides the sensor networks into two-level subspaces according to their geographic locations, and cluster heads are elected in each subspace to form weight incremental propagation trees. Third, each sensor node sends the weight increments it learned to its first-level cluster head. At the first-level cluster head, the weight increments sent by multiple nodes are received and accumulated, and then the results are sent to the second-level cluster head. The base station acquires the weight increments of all the second-level cluster heads and then broadcasts the updated neural network weights to all the WSN nodes.

In this way, ESQG can dynamically adapts each nodes awakening frequency to its dynamic network topology and importance degree of each individual sensing scope. The nodes are then turned on stochasticlly via the node awakening probability and node importance based information fusion is conducted for target detection.

The proposed algorithm includes a form of chromosome coding that had not yet been used in the context of routing and a new multi-objective fitness function. Performance analyzes were carried out establishing exhaustive search (ES) and opportunistic routing (OR) algorithms as comparison references and considering two scenarios: an open field and the other in a closed residential area. Proposed algorithm revealed superior performance when compared to reference algorithms. In open space and in the residential scenario, the lifetime provided by the proposed algorithm was 7320 and transmissions greater than that provided by OR. It was also observed that, with the increase in the number of transmissions, the standard deviation of the nodes’ residual energy is smaller when GAEA-RP is applied, which means the predictability of the energy consumed by them. After 1.8×105 transmissions, it was 0.105 J for GAEA-RP versus 0.188 J for OR in the first scenario. In the second scenario, in addition to the smaller standard deviation of the residual energy, the proposed algorithm provides an average energy very close to that obtained with OR, which indicates the possibility of its application in environments with more obstacles.

These networks, without infrastructure and self-organization, are easily deployed in most environments and collect information about environmental phenomena for analysis and proper response to accidents and send them to the basic centers. They do. Wireless sensor networks are made up of some sensor nodes that both act as sensors and act as relay nodes concerning to each other. On the other hand, the lack of infrastructure in these networks has limited resources so that the nodes of the battery are fed with limited energy. Due to the location of networks in difficult and impassable areas, it is not possible to recharge or replace the node battery. Therefore, saving energy consumption in this type of network is one of the most important challenges. Since the rate of energy consumption when sensing information and receiving data packets from another node is a fixed value, so sensor nodes have the highest energy consumption when sending data. Therefore, routing methods try to reduce energy consumption based on systematic approaches. One of the most promising solutions to reduce energy consumption in wireless sensor networks is to cluster the nodes and select the threaded node based on the data transfer parameters so that the average energy consumption in the nodes is reduced and the network lifetime is increased. Therefore, in this research, a new optimization approach using multiobjective genetic algorithm and cuckoo algorithm for clustering wireless sensor networks is presented. In this study, in order to select clustered nodes from a multiobjective genetic algorithms based on reducing intracluster distances and reducing energy consumption in cluster member nodes and near-optimal routing based on cuckoo optimization algorithm to transfer information between nodes have been used in the direction of the cavity.

WSNs face various constraints, encompassing challenges related to communication, clustering management and the finite battery life of nodes. Thus, Energy conservation in such networks is indispensable. Given a constant energy consumption rate during information sensing and reception, the highest energy consumption among sensor nodes occurs during data transmission. One of promising solution to reduce energy consumption is organizing WSN in clusters. Clustering in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) involves grouping sensor nodes into clusters to facilitate efficient data aggregation, communication, and management within the network. This organizational structure helps optimize energy consumption, enhance scalability, and prolong the overall lifespan of the WSN.

In this paper, a reinforcement learning-based sleep scheduling algorithm for CDG (RLSSA-CDG) is proposed. Active nodes selection is modeled as a finite Markov decision process. The mode-free Q learning algorithm is used to search optimal decision strategies. Residual energy of nodes and sampling uniformity are considered into the reward function of the Q learning algorithm for load balance of energy consumption and accurate data reconstruction.

Use of a dedicated positioning device incurs additional cost and reduces battery life; therefore, a range-free localization scheme is promising as a cost-effective approach. However, the main limitation of this approach is that the estimation precision can be affected by factors such as node density, sensing coverage, and topology diversity. Thus, this study investigates and proposes a method for improving a traditional range-free-based localization method (centroid) that uses soft computing approaches in a hybrid model. This model integrates a fuzzy logic system into centroid and uses an extreme learning machine (ELM) optimization technique to capitalize on the strengths of both approaches: the former is properly used with low node density and short coverage, while the latter is used for the opposite—to achieve a robust location estimation scheme. The ratios of known nodes within the sensing coverage range to the total known nodes and of the sensing coverage range to the maximum coverage range are used as adaptive weights for this hybrid model. To further improve the efficiency, especially in heterogeneous topologies, the concept of resultant force vectors is applied to this hybrid model over particle swarm optimization to mitigate the effects of irregular deployments.

Through the clustering mechanism based on geography and energy, ''similar'' large-scale sensor nodes can be efficiently grouped into specific blocks to form the global block information (GBI). Based on GBI, the long-distance block-cross hybrid algorithms are further developed by effectively aggregating inter-block and intra-block data disseminations.

The main research challenges for communication strategy formulation include limited energy resources and varying link conditions. Though energy harvested sensor nodes partially address the problem of energy efficiency, finding an optimal balance between the energy constraint of the nodes and communication reliability is still challenging. Since data loss in such networks may prove to be fatal, it is important to investigate the problem prior to deployment and come up with effective communication strategies for initiating post-deployment operations. Hence, in this paper, the nodes are stochastically modeled as a Markov Decision Process. There is a need to adapt to the changing ambient conditions through exploration and exploitation. So, a modified Q-learning technique is proposed for post-deployment decision-making by the WBAN nodes subject to the dynamic ambient conditions.

To address these issues, this paper proposes an innovative intelligent routing algorithm WOAD3QN-RP, which cleverly integrates swarm intelligence algorithms and deep reinforcement learning. The WOAD3QN-RP not only effectively reduces delay but also balances energy consumption and flexibly adapts to changes in network topology, while simultaneously determining the optimal multi-hop path, effectively extending the lifetime of the network. Firstly, the WOAD3QN-RP algorithm employs the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) to determine the optimal cluster heads (CHs). In the process of selecting CHs, the algorithm comprehensively considers key factors such as the residual energy of nodes, node distance, and communication delay, thereby significantly improving the accuracy and efficiency of CH selection, which contributes to better energy distribution and performance of the network.

Smart grids can be a cost-effective solution to overcome increases in energy demand and ensure power security. Current applications of smart grids involve a large numbers of agents (e.g., electric vehicles). Since each agent must interact with other agents when taking decisions (e.g., movement and scheduling), the computational complexity of smart grid systems increases exponentially with the number of agents. Computational tractability of planning is a significant barrier to implementation of large-scale smart grids of electric vehicles.Existing solution approaches such as mixed-integer programming and dynamic programming are not computationally efficient for high-dimensional problems. This paper proposes a reformulation of a Mixed-Integer Programming model into a Decentralized Markov Decision Process model and solves it using a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning algorithm to address the scalability issues of large-scale smart grid systems. The Decentralized Markov Decision Process model uses centralized training and distributed execution: agents are trained using a unique actor network for each agent and a shared critic network, and then agent execute actions independently from other agents to reduce computation time. The performance of the Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning model is assessed under different configurations of customers and electric vehicles, and compared to the results from deep reinforcement learning and three heuristic algorithms.

However, they are rapidly disappearing due to human activities. Waterbirds are valuable bio-indicators of wetland health, but it is challenging to monitor them effectively. Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks (WMSNs) offer a promising technology for monitoring wetlands. Nonetheless, these networks are constrained in terms of energy, and also encounter challenges associated with large-scale deployments under natural environmental conditions. These conditions introduce harsh circumstances that may not have been anticipated during the pre-deployment testing phase. This paper proposes a Digital Twin (DT) based energy-efficient WMSN monitoring system specifically tailored for waterbirds in wetlands. The system utilizes a unique approach that combines local audio identification and image compression with DT technology to optimize network performance and minimize energy consumption. To reduce unnecessary image transmissions, the system employs a real-time, low-complexity local audio identification phase before triggering image capture. A denoising step is employed to achieve highly accurate bird recognition despite surrounding noises. Each image undergoes a low-complexity compression scheme prior to transmission, further enhancing energy efficiency. To enhance the system’s overall efficiency and effectiveness, DT technology is integrated to create real-time replicas of the WMSN and the monitoring application. A synergistic interaction between the two DTs enables cooperative data-making decision that ensures both QoS (Quality of Service) and QoE (Quality of Experience) requirements are met. Transmission rate control is done using a fuzzy logic decision-making technique. Real-time feedback provides rapid and accurate analysis of the current state of the WMSN, allowing for dynamic adjustments.

The agent in a centralized mobile anchor with directional antenna is introduced to adaptively partition the network into several zones according to the residual energy of hotspots around sink nodes. In addition, machine learning is applied to the mobile anchor to make it adaptable to any traffic pattern. Through interactions with the environment, the agent can discovery a near-optimal control policy for movement of mobile anchor. The policy can achieve minimization of residual energy's variance among sinks, which prevent the early isolation of sink and prolong the network lifetime.",none,

With the total number of users in the routing path, the drop factor is computed. Power dissipation is calculated based on the transmitted data packets versus the amount of total consumed energy. This method reduces the drop ratio by avoiding the high drop factor nodes from being participating in the routing process. It always ensures that the data would be handled by the low dropping ratio nodes, thus the network’s lifetime is improved.

However, CDG with static clustering cannot adapt to time-varying environments in WSNs. In this paper, a reinforcement learning-based dynamic clustering algorithm (RLDCA) for CDG in WSNs is proposed. It is a dynamic and adaptive clustering method aiming to further reduce data transmissions and energy consumption in WSNs.

The development of wireless sensor networks that strengthen the life cycle of their network through energy saving is an important issue. Due to the low resource development of the sensor terminals, they must be used intelligently and efficiently.

Every time the agent selects an action, it receives a corresponding payoff from an unknown distribution. Thus, the agent must trade-off between exploration of new better action and exploitation of current best action. Content retrieval in Named Data Networks (NDN) commences with a consumer requesting the desired content by sending an Interest that hits multiple content sources over different paths. As the corresponding Interest arrives, the content sources respond by replying the matching Data to the requester. In this work, Data replying problem in NDN is considered a TABB problem, denoted as DTABB. Since numerous sources are available, a content source in DTABB can choose between responding with entire content and partial content once the corresponding Interest strikes. The best source is trained to answer with complete data, while other (sub-optimal) sources learn to react with partial (or payload-free) data. The proposed strategy is formulated from a source’s viewpoint, which uses four prominent reinforcement learning algorithms: greedy, ε-greedy, Upper Confidence Bound (UCB1), and Gradient Bandit to select the optimal action. Eventually, the network picture converges to a point where a single source is exploited for whole data while others send only partial data.

Determining the sleep/wake schedule of body nodes (BNs) is an efficient way to achieve self-sustainability. Sleeping nodes should be connected to at least one active node to reduce delay and keep the network connected. There are two fundamental problems with previous methods for determining BN's sleep/wake schedule: (1) BN suffers from emergency packet loss and unnecessary frequent sleeping and waking up, and (2) They do not guarantee network connectivity. Studies that have only examined connectivity in EH-WBAN also have two main issues: (1) BNs are considered homogenous in terms of energy harvesting and its consumption, (2) These methods cannot adapt to the time-varying behavior of energy-harvesting resources. This study proposes a new method for sleep/wake scheduling called Reinforcement Learning-based Sleep Scheduling (RLS2). RLS2 has the following innovative points: (1) To avoid emergency packet loss or unnecessary frequent sleeping and waking up, each BN has its own sleep/wake schedule based on its energy level and sensed data changes, (2) Lowest possible number of BNs are determined as relay nodes in each round to increase network reliability and connectivity; these BNs remain active in each round, while the others operate according to the determined schedule. In this part of the proposed method: (1) Heterogeneous BNs are considered, (2) As a first step in solving adaptability, the problem of finding the optimal active groups is formulated as a Markov decision process (MDP), followed by a Q-learning algorithm capable of learning time-varying behavior of energy harvesting resources, (3) The unavailable action space is removed to reduce the problem's complexity, (4) To achieve good Q-learning performance, a reward function based on residual energy level and neighborhood degree of BNs is defined. It can find an active group with the lowest cardinality in the current round, which is maximum in terms of the residual energy of its sensors.

Usually, a head node (among neighboring or special purpose nodes) can collect data packets from the nodes and forward them further to sink or other head nodes. In Time-division multiple access (TDMA) driven scheduling, nodes often own slots in a time frame and are scheduled for data forwarding in the allotted time slot (owner node) in each time frame. A time frame in which the owner node does not have data to forward goes into sleep mode. Though the supposed owner node is in sleep mode, the corresponding head node is active throughout the time frame. This active period of a head node can cause an increase in energy consumption. Besides, because the head node in an active state does not receive a data packet, it is causing significantly to the throughput, ultimately leading to low channel utilization. We propose the Markov design policy (MDP) for such head nodes to reduce the number of time slots wasted in the time frame in our work.

Overhead-Controlled routing in WSNs with reinforcement learning,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/978-3-642-32639-4_75,0,Article,ACM,2012,"The use of wireless sensor networks in industry has been increased past few years, bringing multiple benefits compared to wired systems, like network flexibility and manageability. Such networks consist of a possibly large number of small and autonomous sensor and actuator devices with wireless communication capabilities. The data collected by sensors are sent -- directly or through intermediary nodes along the network -- to a base station called sink node. The data routing in this environment is an essential matter since it is strictly bounded to the energy efficiency, thus the network lifetime. This work investigates the application of a routing technique based on reinforcement learning's Q-learning algorithm to a wireless sensor network by using an NS-2 simulated environment.

This work addresses the routing issue, which is critical in successfully establishing and utilizing an underwater network. In particular, it focuses on reinforcement learning (RL)-based routing algorithms, which possess the ability to explore the network environment and adapt routing decisions to the constantly changing topology of the network due to node mobility and energy usage. This paper presents a routing algorithm based on Q-learning, one of the RL approaches, with additional Kinematic and Sweeping features, therefore referred to as QKS. These two additional features are introduced to address the potential slow convergence associated with pure RL algorithms. The results of a detailed packet-level simulation have been obtained using the NS-2 open-source network simulator with underwater modeling additions. The energy efficiency, convergence, and delivery performance of QKS are compared with two other routing protocols for underwater networks, a basic flooding approach (ICRP (Liang, 2007)) and a basic Q-learning implementation (QELAR (Hu, 2010)), using simulations of networks with both fixed and mobile nodes.",none,
CRLM: A cooperative model based on reinforcement learning and metaheuristic algorithms of routing protocols in wireless sensor networks,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.comnet.2023.110019,1,research-article,ACM,2023,"In wireless sensor networks, reasonable clustering and routing are keys to efficient energy utilization. However, the selection of cluster heads and routes is NP-hard. Most of the existing routing protocols use heuristic or metaheuristic optimization algorithms to solve this problem. Most protocols regard the selection of the cluster head and routing as two independent problems. However, the selection of cluster heads will affect the selection of routes, and there is a certain relationship between the two stages. Therefore, considering these two problems independently, the solution obtained is not necessarily the optimal solution in the network. In addition, most of the existing routing protocols are still subject to conventional clustering and conventional multi-hop communication in the network, which is extremely unfavorable for reducing the energy consumption of nodes. In this paper, we propose a cooperative model based on reinforcement learning and metaheuristic algorithms called CRLM, in which we use reinforcement learning to enhance the merit-seeking capability of the metaheuristic algorithm and use the algorithm to solve network communication schemes (clustering and routing are considered as one phase). The communication scheme also achieves load balancing of clusters within the network through pruning and employs a novel multi-hop model to reduce network energy waste. Compared to E-ALWO, ChOA-HGS, GATERP, GWO, IPSO-GWO, and LEACH, CRLM has 56%, 95%, 34.5%, 85.7%, 116.7%, and 140.7% improvements in network lifetime.Graphical abstractDisplay OmittedHighlights•Control the updating of meta-heuristic algorithms using reinforcement learning.•The Integrated Cluster-Routing Solution is used to logically pair cluster and route.•A pruning-based cluster pruning rule is used to balance the load on cluster heads.•Spanning multi-hop is developed to reduce the energy consumption of cluster heads.",none,
Enhanced WSN Routing Protocol for Internet of Things to Process Multimedia Big Data,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s11277-021-08760-1,0,research-article,ACM,2022,"Due to the massive use of wireless Internet of Things (IoT), the advent of multimedia-big-data in recent decades poses numerous obstacles for successful contact with the virtual era. Mobile Adhoc Network-based IoT (MANET IoT) framework is increasingly common in this regard owing to its increased communication protocols and economic efficiency. MANET comprises arbitrary, battery-driven, roaming nodes that do not have architecture that can handle the traffic and control the IoT network. In MANET-IoT, energy usage and traffic management for the handling of MBD information are significant issues. For rapid and precise response, it is essential to route or forward information like the locations of happenings and defected in a disaster. However, it is difficult to transfer this information to the Wireless Sensor Network in disaster areas because the current networks are a disaster that has been removed. In these situations, the transmission of opportunistic knowledge may play a vital role. Current opportunistic protocols need large messages for the restoration of the cluster that leads to more energy consumption and packet loss. To overcome these issues, this work proposes the reliable, energy-efficient opportunistic protocol known as Opportunistic Density Clustering Routing Protocol. This method sends information opportunistically in emergencies and disasters through a density-clustering protocol. Results from simulations demonstrate that the designed protocol exceeds several well-known current routing mechanisms for network energy usage and dissemination of information.",none,

Enhancing network lifespan in wireless sensor networks using deep learning based Graph Neural Network,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.phycom.2023.102076,1,research-article,ACM,2023,"Inadequate energy of sensors is one of the most significant challenges in the development of a reliable wireless sensor network (WSN) that can withstand the demands of growing WSN applications. Implementing a sleep-wake scheduling scheme while assigning data collection and sensing chores to a dominant group of awake sensors while all other nodes are in a sleep state seems to be a potential way for preserving the energy of these sensor nodes. When the starting energy of the nodes changes from one node to another, this issue becomes more difficult to solve. The notion of a dominant set-in graph has been used in a variety of situations. The search for the smallest dominant set in a big graph might be time-consuming. Specifically, we address two issues: first, identifying the smallest possible dominant set, and second, extending the network lifespan by saving the energy of the sensors. To overcome the first problem, we design and develop a deep learning-based Graph Neural Network (DL-GNN). The GNN training method and back-propagation approach were used to train a GNN consisting of three networks such as transition network, bias network, and output network, to determine the minimal dominant set in the created graph. As a second step, we proposed a hybrid fixed-variant search (HFVS) method that considers minimal dominant sets as input and improves overall network lifespan by swapping nodes of minimal dominating sets. We prepared simulated networks with various network configurations and modeled different WSNs as undirected graphs. To get better convergence, the different values of state vector dimensions of the input vectors are investigated. When the state vector dimension is 3 or 4, minimum dominant set is recognized with high accuracy. The paper also presents comparative analyses between the proposed HFVS algorithm and other existing algorithms for extending network lifespan and discusses the trade-offs that exist between them. Lifespan of wireless sensor network, which is based on the dominant set method, is greatly increased by the techniques we have proposed.",none,

This approach allows the system to intelligently select among various routing algorithms in response to changes in the system state, resulting in improved dual optimization of energy efficiency and QoS metrics.

PEARL: Power and Delay-Aware Learning-based Routing Policy for IoT Applications,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9849862/,0,Conference Paper,IEEE,2022,"Routing between the IoT nodes has been considered an important challenge, due to its impact on different link/node metrics, including power consumption, reliability, and latency. Due to the low-power and lossy nature of IoT environments, the amount of consumed power, and the ratio of delivered packets plays an important role in the overall performance of the system. Meanwhile, in some IoT applications, e.g., remote health-care monitoring systems, other factors such as End-to-End (E2E) latency is significantly crucial. The standardized routing mechanism for IoT networks (RPL) tries to optimize these parameters via specified routing policies in its Objective Function (OF). The original version of this protocol, and many of its existing extensions are not well-suited for dynamic IoT networks. In the past few years, reinforcement learning methods have significantly involved in dynamic systems, where agents have no acknowledgment about their surrounding environment. These techniques provide a predictive model based on the interaction between an agent and its environment to reach a semi-optimized solution; For instance, the matter of packet transmission, and their delivery in unstable IoT networks. Accordingly, this paper introduces PEARL; a machine-learning based routing policy for IoT networks, which is both, delay-aware, and power-efficient. PEARL employs a novel routing policy based on the q-learning algorithm, which uses the one-hop E2E delay as its main path selection metric to determine the rewards of the algorithm, and to improve the E2E delay, and consumed power simultaneously in terms of Power-Delay-Product (PDP). According to an extensive set of experiments conducted in the Cooja simulator, in addition to improving reliability in the network in terms of Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), PEARL has improved the amount of E2E delay, and PDP metrics in the network by up to 61% and 72%, against the state-of-the-art, respectively.","Internet Of Things ,  Internet Of Things Applications ,  Routing Policy ,  Objective Function ,  Power Consumption ,  Internet Of Things Networks ,  Q-learning Algorithm ,  Internet Of Things Nodes ,  Amount Of Delay ,  Packet Delivery Ratio ,  Routing Mechanism ,  Dense Network ,  Root Node ,  Neighboring Nodes ,  Optimal Path ,  Markov Decision Process ,  Wireless Sensor Networks ,  Data Packets ,  Reinforcement Learning Algorithm ,  Increase In Transmission ,  Candidate Parents ,  Received Signal Strength Indicator ,  Maximum Reward ,  Receiver Node ,  Static Network ,  Control Packets ,  Mobile Nodes ,  Path Delay ,  Data Packet Transmission ,  Control Messages ",

To enable Industry 4.0 (I4.0) and the IIoT, an intelligent resource allocation is required to make optimal use of the available resources. For this purpose, a multi-agent system (MAS) based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is already taken into account in different communication networks, e.g. for intelligent routing. Despite its great potential, little attention is paid to these methods in industry so far. In this work, DRL is applied for resource allocation and load balancing for industrial edge computing. An optimal usage of the available resources of the IIoT devices should be achieved. Due to the structure of IIoT systems as well as for security reasons, a MAS is preferred for decentralized decision making. In subsequent steps, it is planned to add and remove devices during runtime, to change the number of tasks to be executed as well as evaluations on single- and multi-policy-approaches.

Reinforcement Learning and Vector-based Clustering Method to Achieve Energy Balanced in Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10608266/,0,Conference Paper,IEEE,2024,"Underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs) have a wide range of applications, such as water quality monitoring, ocean data collection and underwater resource exploration. In UASN applications, the management of energy is very important. Sensor nodes in UASNs are usually powered by batteries, which are very difficult to replace and replenish. Extending the life cycle by reducing the energy consumption of UASNs can reduce the network operation cost. Therefore, the energy management problem has become a popular research topic in UASNs. The efficiency of cluster routing in reducing the communication overhead between nodes in the network has been verified by dividing nodes into clusters and having the cluster header (CH) responsible for communicating with the base station and other nodes. However, if the cluster headers and paths are not properly chosen, the energy consumption of the nodes will be unbalanced, thus leading to premature death of the nodes. In this paper, a reinforcement learning and vector-based clustering (RVC) method is proposed to achieve energy balancing in UASNs. We use reinforcement learning and vector forwarding methods to select appropriate CHs and relay nodes to balance the node energy consumption based on the residual energy of the nodes, the transmission distance and the node density in the direction of the routing vector.

Taking the moving vehicle as a mobile sink, a reinforcement learning-based routing approach is proposed to support sink mobility and enable direct interactions between WSN and vehicles. Multiple metrics including time delay, network lifetime and reliability are ensured by designing a comprehensive reward function for learning. The convergence speed of learning is improved with sink announcement. Simulation results show the feasibility of the proposed approach for direct interactions between WSN and moving vehicles. Comparisons are also carried out to show the superiority of the proposed approach over other approaches.","Direct Interaction ,  Sensor Networks ,  Learning-based Approaches ,  Wireless Sensor Networks ,  Vehicle Motion ,  Routing Approach ,  Time Delay ,  Collection Of Information ,  Reward Function ,  Real Information ,  Traffic Information ,  Network Lifetime ,  Data Transmission ,  Network Performance ,  Energy Distribution ,  Optimal Policy ,  Delivery Rate ,  Traffic Conditions ,  Data Packets ,  Road Conditions ,  Hop Count ,  Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks ,  Road Vehicles ,  Residual Energy ,  Reward Information ,  Routing Table ,  Vehicular Applications ,  Received Signal Strength ,  Routing Algorithm ,  Optimal Metrics ",
Mobile Charger Utility Maximization through Preemptive Scheduling for Rechargeable WSNs,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9719458/,3,Conference Paper,IEEE,2021,"Prolong the network lifetime is the primary challenge of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). There are several ways to enhance the lifetime, such as through efficient routing, mobile sink, energy harvesting, etc. A recent breakthrough on wireless charging introduced another state-of-art technique to prolong the network lifetime by recharging the sensor nodes wirelessly. However, selecting the efficient order to charge the nodes among the requesting nodes is a challenging task. In this context, we propose a mobile charger utility maximization approach through preemptive scheduling (MCUMPS) for wireless rechargeable sensor networks (WRSNs). In this approach, we mainly focus on the visiting order of the mobile charger by segregating the sensor nodes into two categories called critical nodes and emerging nodes. Critical nodes (CNs) are high priority than the emerging nodes because the dying of CNs isolate some part of the network. So, we tested the proposed MCUMPS algorithm through simulation, and we observe the surmount performance over the existing but related works.","Wireless Sensor Networks ,  Charge Mobility ,  Utility Maximization ,  Preemptive Scheduling ,  Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks ,  Challenging Task ,  Energy Harvesting ,  Sensor Networks ,  Wireless Sensor ,  Critical Nodes ,  Wireless Charging ,  Network Lifetime ,  Estimation Algorithm ,  Time Of Occurrence ,  Leaf Node ,  Wireless Power Transfer ,  Deep Reinforcement Learning ,  Charging Time ,  Scheduling Scheme ,  Scheduling Approach ,  Priority Queue ,  Network Partitioning ",
Autonomic and Distributed Joint Routing and Power Control for Delay-Sensitive Applications in Multi-Hop Wireless Networks,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5648764/,53,Journal Article,IEEE,2011,"Multi-hop wireless networks can provide flexible network infrastructures at a low cost. However, most existing wireless networking solutions are designed for delay-insensitive applications, thereby resulting in poor performance when handling delay-sensitive applications. Traditionally, network design problems are formulated as static optimizations, by assuming the network characteristics remain static. However, these solutions are not optimal when the environments are dynamic. Recently, several research works apply machine learning to maximize the performance of multi-hop wireless networks in dynamic environments, but they either only focus on determining policies at the network layer, without considering the lower-layers' actions, or use centralized learning approaches, which are inefficient for delay-sensitive applications, due to the large delay when propagating messages throughout the network. We propose in this paper a new solution that enables the nodes to autonomously determine their routing and transmission power to maximize the network utility, in a dynamic environment. We formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process, and propose a distributed computation of the optimal policy. Moreover, we use reinforcement-learning to find the optimized policy when the dynamics are unknown. We explicitly consider the impact of the information overhead on the network performance, and propose several novel algorithms to reduce the information overhead.","Wireless Networks ,  Power Control ,  Joint Power ,  Delay-sensitive Applications ,  Joint Power Control ,  Multi-hop Wireless Networks ,  Joint Routing ,  Dynamic Environment ,  Network Layer ,  Network Performance ,  Transmission Power ,  Optimal Policy ,  Distributed Computing ,  Markov Decision Process ,  Learning Center ,  Large Delay ,  Network Utility ,  Multi-hop Networks ,  Network Design Problem ,  Value Function ,  State Transition Probability ,  Time Slot ,  Routing Decisions ,  Value Function Approximation ,  Independent Markov Chain ,  Queue Size ,  Data Packets ,  Information Exchange ,  Frequency Of Feedback ,  Relay Selection ",
Performance Enhancement in Underwater Optical Wireless Communication using Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10290678/,0,Conference Paper,IEEE,2023,"Recent years have witnessed increased studies focusing on underwater optical wireless communication, also known as UOWC. This is due to the proliferation of new uses for this technology, including military defense, ecological control, and marine ecological preservation. A developing method for direct transmission over the water surface is UOWC. Nevertheless, because of restricted energy supplies and an architecture that is relatively variable due to water flow motion, it is challenging to offer low-consumption and dependable routing in UOWC because of the high directionality of optical rays and the harsh marine conditions. It is necessary to provide enhanced communication for UOWC. As a result, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) strategy is suggested to improve underwater communication. To better respond to a changing ecosystem and extend system longevity, the network is initially represented as a deep decentralized network, with residual power and connection reliability considered while designing the routing mechanism. The effectiveness of the proposed system is assessed by comparison with existing systems. Several assessment standards, including packet delivery ratio, error rate, energy consumption, and computation time.

Emergency Navigation in Confined Spaces Using Dynamic Grouping,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7373229/,2,Conference Paper,IEEE,2015,"The performance of Emergency Management Systems (EMS) in confined spaces is highly dependent on the decision algorithm employed for the safe navigation of the evacuees to the available exits. In the algorithm proposed in this paper, we have considered evacuees under two groups, based on their age and physical condition, and we tailor two routing metrics, one for each group, in finding suitable paths for the evacuees. A dynamic grouping mechanism that can adjust an evacuee's group, and therefore routing metric, according to its on-going health condition is employed during the evacuation. To implement the routing metrics, we have used the Cognitive Packet Network (CPN) with random neural networks (RNN) and reinforcement learning. The CPN is an adaptive routing protocol that is loop-free at all times and easily handles multiple quality of service (QoS) metrics.

Quality of Service Factor based Unfailing Route Formation in Wireless Sensor Network,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10090966/,36,Conference Paper,IEEE,2023,"Nowadays, several analytical methods exist to make unfailing route formation. However, it is still challenging work because the wireless medium is unreliable. Sensor nodes are utilized for widespread distribution. Thus, security issues greatly affect wireless sensor networks (WSN). The Quality of Service Factor-based Unfailing Route (QFUR) Formation in WSN is introduced to solve these issues. In this approach, Quality of Service (QoS) factors like sensor node delay, packet drop, and residual energy is verified to determine whether the sensor node is normal. The value of the QoS factor is less than the threshold for that node to be a normal sensor node in the WSN. This approach is serious to notice and separate the compromised nodes from evading misinformation through the falsified data inserted by the opponent over compromised nodes. The Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm computes the reward value based on node energy utilization, hop count, dropped rate, and delay. The simulation outcomes demonstrate a lesser delay and lesser packet loss in the network. Furthermore, it improves the opponent node's detection and minimizes the false negative ratio in the WSN.","Service Quality ,  Wireless Sensor Networks ,  Energy Utilization ,  Reinforcement Learning Algorithm ,  Network Loss ,  Residual Energy ,  Network Delay ,  Normal Nodes ,  Packet Drop ,  Hop Count ,  Communication Network ,  Energy Availability ,  Value Of Node ,  Drop Rate ,  Simulated Networks ,  Technical Results ,  Received Signal Strength ,  Routing Algorithm ,  Authentication Method ,  Incentive Value ",
A Multi-AUV Collaborative Ocean Data Collection Method Based on LG-DQN and Data Value,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10272719/,3,Journal Article,IEEE,2024,"As a result of the development of the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT), underwater connected devices generate a large volume of data with varying values and time sensitivity.

To address the aforementioned issues, this article proposes a cooperative data collection method (MADC-DV) for multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) based on local global deep 
 $Q$ 
 learning (LG-DQN) and data value, which divides data into emergency and nonemergency and achieves hybrid data collection. First, the MAC protocol for communication between AUVs and clusters is designed to divide nonemergency data into high-value data and low-value data, with low-value data not needing to reply to ACK acknowledgment packets, thereby reducing the nonemergency data collection delay. Second, nonemergency data are collected cooperatively using multiple AUVs, and the LG-DQN approach is used to plan the paths for multiple AUV data collection in order to reduce the overall energy consumption of underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs). Finally, emergency data are collected using a multihop routing approach to assist in the collection. A routing method is proposed to compensate for the inability of AUVs to be applied to emergency data collection. The experimental results indicate that the method can improve the network life cycle by 18.7%, reduce the delay in the collection of nonemergency data by 40%, and reduce the delay in the collection of emergency data by 26.3%, thereby meeting the varying time requirements for different types of data.","Data Collection Methods ,  Ocean Data ,  Collaborative Method ,  Energy Consumption ,  Deep Learning ,  Sensor Networks ,  Time Requirements ,  Communication Protocol ,  Wireless Sensor ,  Wireless Sensor Networks ,  Autonomous Underwater Vehicles ,  Multiple Data Collection ,  Routing Method ,  Network Energy Consumption ,  Data Collection In Order ,  Average Energy ,  Network Size ,  Area Data ,  Path Planning ,  Neighboring Nodes ,  Cluster Head ,  Routing Algorithm ,  Cluster Nodes ,  Data Packets ,  Value Threshold ,  Transmission Phase ,  Hold Time ,  Energy Of Nodes ,  Delay Data ,  Deep Reinforcement Learning ",
Managing Crowds in Hazards With Dynamic Grouping,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7152824/,38,Journal Article,IEEE,2015,"Emergency navigation algorithms for evacuees in confined spaces typically treat all evacuees in a homogeneous manner, using a common metric to select the best exit paths. In this paper, we present a quality of service (QoS) driven routing algorithm to cater to the needs of different types of evacuees based on age, mobility, and level of resistance to fatigue and hazard. Spatial information regarding the location and the spread of hazards is also integrated into the routing metrics to avoid situations where evacuees may be directed toward hazardous zones. Furthermore, rather than persisting with a single decision algorithm during an entire evacuation process, we suggest that evacuees may adapt their course of action with regard to their ongoing physical condition and environment. A widely tested routing protocol known as the cognitive packet network with random neural networks and reinforcement learning are employed to collect information and provide advice to evacuees, and is beneficial in emergency navigation owing to its low computational complexity and its ability to handle multiple QoS metrics in its search for safe exit paths. The simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm, which is sensitive to the needs of evacuees, produces better results than the use of a single metric.

A gradient based routing protocol is proposed, that integrates a Reinforcement Learning (RL) component to learn and seek out routes which deplete node energy in a balanced manner. This RL enhanced protocol was compared against three other gradient based protocols, including a greedy, shortest-paths variation serving as a baseline.

Intrusion Prevention Scheme Against Rank Attacks for Software-Defined Low Power IoT Networks,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9978298/,2,Journal Article,IEEE,2022,"The 6LoWPAN (IPv6 over low-power wireless personal area networks) standard enables resource-constrained devices to connect to the IPv6 network, blending an IPv6 header compression protocol. For this network technology, a new routing protocol called Routing Protocol for Low Power Lossy network (RPL) has been designed. The latter is a lightweight protocol that determines the route across the nodes based on rank values. This protocol is known to be non-resilient against Rank attacks, which aim at creating non-optimized routes for packet forwarding, hence overwhelming the constrained 6LoWPAN. With 5G, Software-Defined Networks (SDNs) have been developed to facilitate simple programmable control plane, Quality of Service (QoS) provisioning, and route configuration services for 6LoWPAN. However, there is still a lack of optimization mechanisms to protect 6LoWPAN against Rank attacks in SDN-based deployment. To this end, in this paper, a Reinforcement-Learning (RL) agent is leveraged to assist and complement an SDN controller in achieving cost-efficient route optimization, and QoS provisioning packet forwarding to prevent rank attacks. Experimental results confirm that our approach effectively prevents Rank attacks while providing an adequate delay and radio duty cycle.

A recent approach utilizes real-time sensing of MC health status, and attempts to avoid degraded electrodes during droplet routing. However, the problem with this solution is that the computational complexity is unacceptable for MEDA biochips of realistic size. Consequently, in this work, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach to bypass degraded electrodes and enhance the reliability of routing. The DRL model utilizes the information of health sensing in real time to proactively reduce the likelihood of charge trapping and avoid using degraded MCs. Simulation results show that our approach provides effective routing strategies for COVID-19 testing protocols. We also validate our DRL-based approach using fabricated prototype biochips. Experimental results show that the developed DRL model completed the routing tasks using a fewer number of clock cycles and shorter total execution time, compared with a baseline routing method.

So, in this paper, we assume that the current network delay is not known but an estimated maximum value of fluctuating network delays is known beforehand. Moreover, we also assume that the sensor cannot observe all state variables of the plant. Under these assumption, we apply continuous deep Q-learning to the design of the networked controller.

Utilizing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) technology to facilitate the transfer of data from buoy sensor nodes, it becomes feasible to significantly reduce the latency generated in the transmission process. Therefore, we introduce a UAV-assisted maritime Internet of Things (MIoT) data collection mechanism based on relay cooperation. In this mechanism, through relay transmissions among UAVs, it avoids UAVs located distant from the shipboard station from having to traverse extensive distances in order to offload data to the shipboard station. Based on this, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based cooperative data collection (DCDC) scheme. In this scheme, firstly, we select the convergence node in charge of forwarding the data from buoy sensor nodes to the passing UAVs. Next, to achieve dynamic adaptation of the task areas for UAVs, we propose an adaptive partition algorithm based on virtual moving points. Subsequently, to establish relay transmission links between UAVs, we present a routing algorithm based on matching game theory. Finally, to reduce time costs in delivering collected data to the shipboard station, we utilize a deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) plan the flight paths of UAVs. Additionally, we introduce virtual waypoints in the path planning algorithm, which enables that paired UAVs can high-efficiently perform data forwarding through encounter opportunities.

They are often deployed in hostile, unattended, and unfavourable conditions. Securing them often becomes very challenging. The extent of interconnected LLN devices poses a series of routing threats (e.g. wormhole, grayhole, DIO suppression, and increase rank attacks).

However, limited radio range and lack of scalability of conventional wireless sensor networks do not allow a wide area connectivity among IoT devices. To address these challenges, Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs) are emerging to provide long-range communication capability with low-power consumption of the end devices. Nevertheless, given the demand in delivering an increasingly large volume of data generated by IoT devices, the direct data transmission model is not suitable due to its poor network lifetime. Therefore, in this work, a multi-hop data routing method is proposed for LPWANs. Since multi-hop data transmission faces several challenges such as increased data latency, higher interference, and reduced data throughput (i.e., poor bandwidth utilization), we propose a reinforcement learning method to address those challenges. The proposed method updates the Q-matrix of the network at varying discrete time instants and selects relay devices in such a way that maximizes the cumulative reward value between selected device-gateway pairs. The applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method are illustrated over both simulated LPWAN testbed and real field data sets.

Large-Scale Mixed Traffic Control Using Dynamic Vehicle Routing and Privacy-Preserving Crowdsourcing,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10324334/,0,Journal Article,IEEE,2024,"Controlling and coordinating urban traffic flow through robot vehicles (RVs) is emerging as a novel transportation paradigm for the future. While this approach garners growing attention from researchers and practitioners, effectively managing and coordinating large-scale mixed traffic remains a challenge. We introduce an effective framework for large-scale mixed traffic control via privacy-preserving crowdsourcing and dynamic vehicle routing. Our framework consists of three modules: 1) a privacy-protecting crowdsensing method; 2) a graph propagation-based traffic forecasting method; and 3) a privacy-preserving route selection mechanism. We evaluate our framework using a real-world road network. The results show that our framework accurately forecasts traffic flow, efficiently mitigates network-wide RV shortage issue, and coordinates large-scale mixed traffic. Compared to other baseline methods, our framework not only reduces the RV shortage issue up to 69.4% but also reduces the average waiting time of all vehicles in the network up to 27%.","Traffic Control ,  Vehicle Routing ,  Dynamic Vehicle Routing ,  Road Network ,  Autonomous Vehicles ,  Traffic Flow ,  Baseline Methods ,  Real-world Networks ,  Route Selection ,  Vehicle Network ,  Traffic Forecasting ,  Mean Absolute Error ,  Intersectional ,  Entire Network ,  Light Signal ,  Coordinating Center ,  Directed Graph ,  Traffic Light ,  Traffic Conditions ,  Mean Absolute Percentage Error ,  Road Segments ,  Internet Of Vehicles ,  Traffic Information ,  Traffic Efficiency ,  Route Planning ,  Rate Of Segments ,  Routing Algorithm ,  Privacy Preservation ,  Rush Hour ,  Traffic Data ",

We introduce a paradigm called Trusted Machine Learning (TML) for making ML models more trustworthy. We use Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) as the underlying dynamical model and outline three TML approaches: (1) Model Repair, wherein we modify the learned model directly; (2) Data Repair, wherein we modify the data so that re-learning from the modified data results in a trusted model; and (3) Reward Repair, wherein we modify the reward function of the MDP to satisfy the specified logical constraint. We show how these repairs can be done efficiently for probabilistic models (e.g., MDP) when the desired properties are expressed in some appropriate fragment of logic such as temporal logic (for example PCTL, i.e., Probabilistic Computation Tree Logic), first order logic or propositional logic.

IoVSSA: Efficient Mobility-Aware Clustering Algorithm in Internet of Vehicles Using Sparrow Search Algorithm,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10012622/,11,Journal Article,IEEE,2023,"Internet of Vehicles (IoV), a branch of Internet of Things utilized for vehicle-to-vehicle communication, is attracting attention from both academia and industry. Vehicle nodes are thought to be constantly moving at high speeds, and as a result, IoV faces major challenges, including scalability, rapid topology changes, and shortest routing path. Vehicle clustering is an effective way to enhance IoV communication performance in a large network setting with complicated road conditions and huge number of vehicles. At the same, minimal clusters and selection of stable cluster heads (CHs) reinforce the cluster structure stability. In this sight, we propose a new clustering algorithm based on the recent nature-inspired metaheuristic IoV clustering using sparrow search algorithm (IoVSSA). IoVSSA incorporates mobility metrics along the cluster distance to construct the fewest clusters with stable CHs. Through simulation studies, the effectiveness of the proposed IoVSSA algorithm is assessed and is found to perform better than the state-of-the-art algorithms when it comes to the number of vehicle clusters and average cluster lifetime.

Addressing these challenges, this work considers a node repair scheme for multiple autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to search and repair faulty nodes to ensure the stable operation of the IoUT networks. Moreover, AUVs should adapt automatically to the unknown environment, working in cooperative or separative modes to balance repair efficiency and coverage.

RPL is a routing protocol for low-power loss wireless networks, but there is an inefficient aspect of P2P communication. Although P2P-RPL has been proposed to support P2P of RPL, it is inappropriate to apply it to 6TiSCH networks as it is due to excessive overhead. So, we propose Lightweight P2P-RPL and applied to 6TiSCH Networks. Lightweight P2P-RPL includes five techniques for reducing overhead, and the performance was measured using a 6TiSCH simulator.

Differentially Private Malicious Agent Avoidance in Multiagent Advising Learning,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8685696/,31,Journal Article,IEEE,2020,"Agent advising is one of the key approaches to improve agent learning performance by enabling agents to ask for advice between each other. Existing agent advising approaches have two limitations. The first limitation is that all the agents in a system are assumed to be friendly and cooperative. However, in the real world, malicious agents may exist and provide false advice to hinder the learning performance of other agents. The second limitation is that the analysis of communication overhead in these approaches is either overlooked or simplified. However, in communication-constrained environments, communication overhead has to be carefully considered. To overcome the two limitations, this paper proposes a novel differentially private agent advising approach. Our approach employs the Laplace mechanism to add noise on the rewards used by student agents to select teacher agents. By using the differential privacy technique, the proposed approach can reduce the impact of malicious agents without identifying them. Also, by adopting the privacy budget concept, the proposed approach can naturally control communication overhead.

Neural-Network-Assisted Packet Accelerators for Internet of Things Network Systems,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10094235/,1,Journal Article,IEEE,2023,"Major device nodes within the Internet of Things (IoT) system collects and store information in bit forms of 0’s and 1’s regardless of its repetition. The nodes do not possess the capability of processing redundant data information except for outright rejection/replacement of packets of similar sizes. This becomes a research problem since high volumes of packet redundancy are prevalent owing to repetitive information. Many optimal solutions have been provided to reprocess redundant packets and to store them in edge server for accessibility by other connected IoT systems and networks servers. To do so, major IoT platforms implements tier-based network layers which primarily aid seamless communication among nodes. These network layers perform near-similar tasks of guaranteeing packet sensing and exchange although at often-higher energy requirement. To mitigate the energy concerns, packets are clustered and compressed, allowing exchange of essential information only. But the approach continues to present heavy packet-losses and/or redundancies. In this article, two-tier layered network—where packet exchange is conducted at the top layer in order to lower energy consumption and promote system-reliability is investigated. All packets are first segregated into multiple clusters using the Voronoi cell-based correlation cluster formation (VC3F) technique. Cluster heads (CHs) are identified by their multipath (M-Score) value, thus, assuming sole responsibility of redundant packet removal within each cluster. The redundant packets are then moved to the edge-tier layer using optimized multiobjective flower pollination (MO-FPO) routing, and finally processed using hybrid models of novel fast-fully connected neural network (F2CNN) accelerator and Lempel–Ziv–Welch (LZW) data compression.

A Reinforcement Learning-Based Trust Model for Cluster Size Adjustment Scheme in Distributed Cognitive Radio Networks,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8533448/,22,Journal Article,IEEE,2019,"Cognitive radio enables secondary users (SUs) to explore and exploit the underutilized licensed channels (or white spaces) owned by the primary users. To improve the network scalability, the SUs are organized into clusters. This article proposes a novel artificial intelligence-based trust model approach that uses reinforcement learning (RL) to improve traditional budget-based cluster size adjustment schemes. The RL-based trust model enables the clusterhead to observe and learn about the behaviors of its SU member nodes, and revoke the membership of malicious SUs in order to ameliorate the effects of intelligent and collaborative attacks, while adjusting the cluster size dynamically according to the availability of white spaces. The malicious SUs launch attacks on clusterheads causing the cluster size to become inappropriately sized while learning to remain undetected. In any attack and defense scenario, both the attackers and the clusterhead adopt RL approaches. Simulation results have shown that the single-agent RL (SARL) attackers have caused the cluster size to reduce significantly; while the SARL clusterhead has slightly helped increase its cluster size, and this motivates a rule-based approach to efficiently counterattack. Multi-agent RL attacks have shown to be less effective in an operating environment that is dynamic.","Cluster Size ,  Cognitive Networks ,  Cognitive Radio ,  Trust Model ,  Scalable ,  Outdoor Environments ,  Availability Of Space ,  Effects Of Attacks ,  White Space ,  Rule-based Approach ,  Attack Scenarios ,  Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning ,  Secondary Users ,  Time Slot ,  Neighboring Nodes ,  Types Of Attacks ,  Cluster Nodes ,  Data Packets ,  OFF State ,  Network Of Agents ,  Attack Intensity ,  Random Attack ,  Malicious Nodes ,  Probability Of Attack ,  Downstream Nodes ,  Neighboring Agents ,  Trust Value ,  Nodes In Order ,  Transmission Range ,  Non-cooperative Game ",
Destination-Oriented Data Collection and Uploading for Mobile Crowdsensing With Multiagent Deep Reinforcement Learning,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10266845/,0,Journal Article,IEEE,2024,"Data collection and uploading are among the most fundamental problems in an mobile crowdsensing (MCS) system and involve complicated interactions among the system’s platform, mobile users, data collection tasks, and data relaying devices. In the article, we propose a destination-oriented data collection and uploading (DDCU) problem in MCS to facilitate cooperation among various entities. In DDCU, mobile device users are recruited as workers to complete data collection tasks and aim to reach their destinations after collecting the required data. At the same time, edge servers are recruited as data relaying devices to share their idle network resources and gain extra profit. The DDCU problem aims to help an MCS platform plan efficient sensing paths for workers to maximize the platform’s total profit. We further prove the DDCU problem to be NP-hard and thus require a time-efficient approximation-based method to solve the problem. In Xu and Song (2022), we proposed communication-QMIX-based multiagent deep reinforcement learning (CQDRL) as a decentralized method for an MCS routing problem. Although CQDRL was proven effective with high performance, it explicitly targets graph-based problems with two types of nodes and requires considerable effort to be extended to more heterogeneous graph problems. In this article, we propose CQDRL-S by simplifying the graph processing part of CQDRL to solve the DDCU problem with three types of nodes. More importantly, CQDRL-S can potentially be extended to other heterogeneous graph problems with moderate modifications. Extensive experiments further justify the effectiveness, efficiency, and simplicity of CQDRL-S in dealing with the DDCU problem.","Deep Reinforcement Learning ,  Data Upload ,  Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning ,  Mobile Crowdsensing ,  Task Completion ,  Network Resources ,  Mobile Users ,  Types Of Nodes ,  Total Profit ,  Routing Problem ,  Edge Server ,  Problem Of Heterogeneity ,  Graph Processing ,  Heterogeneous Graph ,  Graph Problems ,  Usage Of Mobile Devices ,  Computational Resources ,  Number Of Workers ,  Storage Capacity ,  Nodes In The Graph ,  Network Of Agents ,  Heuristic Method ,  Problem Instances ,  Mixed Network ,  Local Observations ,  Different Types Of Nodes ,  Profit Ratio ,  Vector Of Node ,  Knapsack Problem ,  Amount Of Tasks ",
FL_GIoT: Federated Learning Enabled Edge-Based Green Internet of Things System: A Comprehensive Survey,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10323400/,2,Journal Article,IEEE,2023,"In today’s world, the importance of the Green Internet of Things (GIoT) in the transformed sustainable smart cities cannot be overstated. For a variety of applications, the GIoT may make use of advanced machine learning (ML) methodologies. However, owing to high processing costs and privacy issues, centralized ML-based models are not a feasible option for the large data kept at a single cloud server and created by multiple devices. In such circumstances, edge-based computing may be used to increase the privacy of GIoT networks by bringing them closer to users and decentralizing them without requiring a central authority. Nonetheless, enormous amounts of data are stored in a distribution mechanism, and managing them for application purposes remains a difficulty. Hence, federated learning (FL) is one of the most promising solutions for bringing learning to end devices through edge computing without sharing private data with a central server. Therefore, the paper proposes a federated learning-enabled edge-based GIoT system, which seeks to improve the communication strategy while lowering liability in terms of energy management and data security for data transmission. The proposed model uses FL to produce feature values for data routing, which could aid in sensor training for identifying the best routes to edge servers. Furthermore, combining FL-enabled edge-based techniques simplifies security solutions while also allowing for a more efficient computing system. The experimental results show an improved performance against existing models in terms of network overhead, route interruption, energy consumption, and end-to-end delay, route interruption.","Internet Of Things ,  Federated Learning ,  Internet Of Things Systems ,  Green Internet Of Things ,  Energy Consumption ,  Cloud Computing ,  Data Transmission ,  Privacy Issues ,  Smart City ,  Edge Computing ,  Central Server ,  Sustainable Cities ,  Edge Server ,  End Devices ,  Network Overhead ,  Deep Learning ,  Data Storage ,  Global Model ,  Internet Of Things Devices ,  Federated Learning Model ,  Edge Devices ,  Edge Nodes ,  Industrial Internet Of Things ,  Internet Of Things Data ,  Virtual Network Functions ,  Mobile Edge Computing ,  Cloud Providers ,  Deep Reinforcement Learning ,  Heterogeneous Devices ",

BTS: A Blockchain-Based Trust System to Deter Malicious Data Reporting in Intelligent Internet of Things,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9444338/,17,Journal Article,IEEE,2022,"Recent developments in collection, computation and communication have expanded the way of data reporting in intelligent Internet of Things (IoT). However, diversity and complexity of data sources also impose new trust challenge in data collection process since untrust reporters tend to report false or even malicious data, which highlights the need to develop a novel methodology to solve such challenge. Thus, based on this domain, inspired by deterrence theory, this article proposes a blockchain-based trust system with assistant of drones to deter malicious data reporting in intelligent IoT. Specifically, to deter malicious data reporting, based on the blockchain technology, the data sensed by fully trusted drones is public published on blockchain showing participants the data standards, named as malicious deterrence scheme. This scheme provides a barrier for malicious reporters to arbitrarily publish false data to blockchain, since the false data can be easily detected while they cannot deny. Second, to further reduce malicious data reporting, a strict penalty mechanism is proposed to punish malicious reporters who have reported false data to blockchain to reduce the malicious data reporting in the following task through punishment. Third, note that the sensing of data standard generates additional costs, therefore, a drone flight route scheme based on a simper deep reinforcement learning with multihead attention mechanism (MA-DRL) is designed to reduce the flight distance for drones. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate efficiency of our proposed system in terms of reducing malicious data reporting in advance as well as reducing drone flight distance.","Malicious Data ,  Punishment ,  Time-of-flight Mass Spectrometry ,  Attention Mechanism ,  Deep Reinforcement Learning ,  False Data ,  Routing Scheme ,  Deterrence Theory ,  Multi-head Attention Mechanism ,  Normal Range ,  Small Region ,  Sensor Data ,  Recurrent Neural Network ,  Regional Data ,  Smart City ,  Markov Decision Process ,  Randomization List ,  Task Duration ,  End Of The Task ,  Baseline Schemes ,  Mobile Edge Computing ,  Fake Data ,  Dynamic Elements ,  Crowdsourcing ,  Number Of Efforts ,  Service Platform ,  Eristalis ,  Flight Plan ",

The data can be time-sensitive and require to be transmitted to a data processing center. However, planning the trajectory for a swarm of UAVs depends on multi-fold constraints, such as data collection requirements, UAV maneuvering capacities, and budget limitations. Since a UAV may fail or be compromised, it is important to provide necessary resilience to such contingencies, thus ensuring data security. It is important to provide the UAVs with efficient spatio-temporal trajectories so that they can efficiently cover necessary data sources. In this work, we present Synth4UAV, a formal approach for automated synthesis of efficient trajectories for a UAV swarm by logically modeling the aerial space and data point topology, UAV moves, and associated constraints in terms of the turning and climbing angle, fuel usage, data collection point coverage, data freshness, and resiliency properties. We use efficient, logical formulas to encode and solve the complex model. The solution to the model provides the routing and maneuvering plan for each UAV, including the time to visit the points on the paths and corresponding fuel usage such that the necessary data points are visited while satisfying the resiliency requirements.

Time-Constrained Task Allocation and Worker Routing in Mobile Crowd-Sensing Using a Decomposition Technique and Deep Q-Learning,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9474442/,8,Journal Article,IEEE,2021,"Mobile crowd-sensing (MCS) is a data collection paradigm, which recruits mobile users with smart devices to perform sensing tasks on a city-wide scale. In MCS, a key challenge is task allocation, especially when MCS applications are time-sensitive, and the platform needs to consider task completion order (since a worker may perform multiple tasks and different task completion orders lead to different travel costs and response times, i.e., the times needed to arrive at the task venues), requirements of tasks (such as deadline and required sensor) and workers heterogeneity. In other words, the task allocation problem consists of multiple task completion order problems, which is challenging to solve due to the large solution space. Therefore, in this paper, we first formulate the considered problem into two related integer linear programming problems (i.e., assignment and task completion order problems) using a decomposition technique in order to reduce the problem size and enable the use of diverse searching strategies. Then, a deep Q-learning (DQN)-based algorithm, namely assignment DQN with a local search (A-DQN w/ LS), is proposed to determine the task-worker assignments, which iteratively employs an asymmetric traveling salesman (ATSP) heuristic to find the task completion orders of the workers. The local optimizer is applied at the end of the A-DQN algorithm to deal with the computation time and local optima.

Routing based on layered stochastic games for multi-hop cognitive radio networks,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6951923/,1,Conference Paper,IEEE,2014,"This paper proposes a distributed routing mechanism for the multi-hop Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) over multiple primary channels. The Secondary Users (SUs) attempts to utilize the channels and minimize their delay along the route while avoiding causing interference to the Primary Users (PUs). In order to address the problem of time-varying channel condition due to the PU dynamics, the route-selection process is modeled as a global Markov Decision Process (MDP). We show that such a global routing MDP can be decomposed into the layered MDPs, in which the interactions between neighbor SUs with their local next-hop selection are modeled as the local stochastic games. By applying reinforcement learning with utility based fictitious play, the best response of each SU can be learned from the local game with the only need for the information exchange from next-hop SUs.

Secure-Energy Efficient Bio-Inspired Clustering and Deep Learning-Based Routing Using Blockchain for Edge Assisted WSN Environment,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10366278/,0,Journal Article,IEEE,2023,"In recent days, the usage of data transmission has increased in Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) environments due to its dynamic nature. However, WSNs face many issues during data transmission, such as less energy efficiency, less security, and less network lifetime. Here, in this research it presents secure and energy-efficient clustering and routing techniques for an edge-assisted WSN environment to address these problems. The proposed work includes four major processes: Quad tree-based network construction, energy-efficient clustering, RL-based duty cycling, and secure multipath routing. This work constructs the network based on a quad-tree structure to increase network management performance and reduce complexity. After network construction, authentication of sensors is performed by considering ID and location using the Lightweight Encryption Algorithm (LEA), which provides high security by eliminating illegitimate sensor nodes. Then, this research model performs clustering using Tasmanian Devil Optimization (TDO), which selects optimal CH and performs clustering. In contrast, the CH selection and clustering are performed dynamically by considering time and event metrics, which increases communication efficiency and reduces energy depletion. To reduce energy consumption, This research model performs duty cycling using the Improved Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (ITD3) algorithm, increasing the network lifetime. Finally, A secure multipath routing is performed using a game theory-based Generative Adversarial Network (GTGAN). During routing, GTGAN ranks the selected multipath based on their hop counts. The highest-ranked paths are chosen for transmitting an emergency message, and medium-ranked paths are selected for non-emergency message transmission, which reduces data loss due to energy depletion.

An Intelligent Path Planning Mechanism for Firefighting in Wireless Sensor and Actor Networks,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10014987/,4,Journal Article,IEEE,2023,"Forests have an important role in environmental preservation and maintenance. The primary threat is forest fires, which have disastrous repercussions. As a result, it is critical to identify and extinguish a fire before it spreads and destroys resources. To that end, we propose a forest fire detection and fighting mechanism using wireless sensor and actor networks (WSANs). Temperature sensors are utilized to detect fires, and actors (robots) are employed to extinguish them. Sensors and robots are distributed at random throughout the forest, forming clusters. Clustering, sleep/active scheduling for the sensors, and energy harvesting (EH)/moving modes for the robots, are used to extend and maximize the sensors/robots lifetime in the WSAN. In such a network, robots should move to the fire site as quickly as possible. To do this, we further propose a robot routing mechanism that focuses on determining the shortest path for each firefighting robot. In particular, each firefighting robot equipped with on-board processing uses a fuzzy 
 $Q$ 
-learning (FQL)-based trajectory mechanism to learn the shortest path to the fire zone in the least amount of time. Simulations are conducted to demonstrate the benefits of employing the proposed framework for rapid and effective fire response. When compared to the traditional

Mobility-Aware Routing and Caching in Small Cell Networks Using Federated Learning,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10292924/,1,Journal Article,IEEE,2024,"We consider a service cost minimization problem for resource-constrained small-cell networks with caching, where the challenge mainly stems from (i) the insufficient backhaul capacity and limited network bandwidth and (ii) the limited storing capacity of small-cell base stations (SBSs). Besides, the optimization problem is NP-hard since both the users’ mobility patterns and content preferences are unknown. In this paper, we develop a novel mobility-aware joint routing and caching strategy to address the challenges. The designed framework divides the entire geographical area into small sections containing one SBS and several mobile users (MUs). Based on the concept of one-stop-shop (OSS), we propose a federated routing and popularity learning (FRPL) approach in which the SBSs cooperatively learn the routing and preference of their respective MUs and make a caching decision. The FRPL method completes multiple tasks in one shot, thus reducing the average processing time per global aggregation of learning. By exploiting the outcomes of FRPL together with the estimated service edge of SBSs, the proposed cache placement solution greedily approximates the minimizer of the challenging service cost optimization problem.

The BS analyzes this information depending on the sensor location. A high-performance intelligent WSNs is essential for any IoT-based application. In this article, high-performance intelligent WSNs are referred to as IoT-enabled WSNs. In IoT-enabled WSNs, fault occurrence probability is much more than traditional networks. Faulty nodes and broken links affect the reliability of the IoT-enabled WSNs. Various fault-tolerance algorithms enhance the network’s reliability using multipath transmission, relay node placement, and backup node selection.

ECORS: Energy consumption-oriented route selection for wireless sensor network,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7819318/,7,Conference Paper,IEEE,2016,"Automated metering infrastructure is employed widely in scientific fields as well as in industrial and commercial areas due to the development of wireless sensor network (WSN) technology. WSNs provide important features such as wireless multi-hop communication and they are easy to install everywhere; thus, extending the lifetime of WSNs is highly desirable. All WSN nodes consume a limited amount of energy from the battery during operations such as sensing, calculating, control, and communication and most of the power consumption is attributable to wireless communication. In this study, we propose energy consumption-oriented route selection (ECORS), which is a route selection algorithm that focuses on the remaining energy and energy consumption by WSN nodes. In ECORS, a sink node calculates all of the routes in the system by using the route lifetime (RL) as a metric according to the minimum residual energy (MRE) and the expected route cost (ERC). The route with the longest RL is selected by the proposed algorithm. By changing the route periodically using ECORS, the WSN system lasts 1.14 times longer as compared to that when the routes are fixed. We evaluated the performance of ECORS using an original WSN simulator. In realistic simulations, we measured the distance-packet error rate, current consumption, and discharge characteristic of a battery using actual sensor nodes assembled with an Arduino micro controller, XBee ZigBee wireless module, and lithium-polymer battery.","Wireless Sensor ,  Wireless Sensor Networks ,  Route Selection ,  Energy Consumption ,  Selection Algorithm ,  Current Consumption ,  Residual Energy ,  Sink Node ,  Aggregate Data ,  Shortest Path ,  Base Station ,  Topological Changes ,  Monitoring Applications ,  Total Energy Consumption ,  Data Packets ,  Wireless Devices ,  Loss Ratio ,  Destination Node ,  Battery Lifetime ,  System Lifetime ,  Network Lifetime ,  Sleep Mode ,  Battery Level ,  Topology Control ,  Cluster Head ",

To be capable of efficient, long-term learning, RL agents should be able to apply knowledge gained in the past to new tasks they may encounter in the future. The ability to predict actions' consequences may facilitate such knowledge transfer. We consider here domains where an RL agent has access to two kinds of information: agent-centric information with constant semantics across tasks, and environment-centric information, which is necessary to solve the task, but with semantics that differ between tasks. For example, in robot navigation, environment-centric information may include the robot's geographic location, while agent-centric information may include sensor readings of various nearby obstacles. We propose that these situations provide an opportunity for a very natural style of knowledge transfer, in which the agent learns to predict actions' environmental consequences using agent-centric information. These predictions contain important information about the affordances and dangers present in a novel environment, and can effectively transfer knowledge from agent-centric to environment-centric learning systems.

RL-Budget: A Learning-Based Cluster Size Adjustment Scheme for Cognitive Radio Networks,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8119944/,15,Journal Article,IEEE,2018,"Cognitive radio (CR) enables unlicensed users to sense for and access underutilized licensed channels (or white spaces) owned by the licensed users in an opportunistic manner. Clustering segregates nodes in a network into logical groups called clusters. In CR networks (CRNs), larger cluster size improves network scalability thereby contributing to reduced routing overhead; however, it reduces cluster stability as the number of available common channels in a cluster reduces resulting in increased number of re-clusterings and clustering overhead. This paper presents our proposed first-of-its-kind cluster size adjustment scheme based on an artificial intelligence approach called reinforcement learning. The proposed scheme adapts the cluster size with the amount of white spaces as time goes by in order to improve network scalability and cluster stability in CRNs. Due to the lack of progress in the investigation of cluster size adjustment schemes in the literature, this paper also analyzes their attributes, and then presents such schemes investigated in various kinds of distributed wireless networks. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme improves network scalability by creating larger clusters, and improves cluster stability by reducing the number of re-clusterings (i.e., the number of cluster splits) and clustering overhead, while reducing interference between licensed and unlicensed users in CRNs.","Cluster Size ,  Cognitive Networks ,  Cognitive Radio ,  Large Clusters ,  Network Clustering ,  Stable Clusters ,  White Space ,  Common Channel ,  Number Of Splits ,  Channel Clustering ,  Larger Cluster Sizes ,  Schemes In The Literature ,  Energy Consumption ,  Small Clusters ,  Cluster Formation ,  Open Channel ,  Base Station ,  Neighboring Nodes ,  Successful Delivery ,  Cluster Nodes ,  Channel Network ,  Small Cluster Sizes ,  Wireless Sensor Networks ,  Ad Hoc Networks ,  Neighbor Clustering ,  OFF Periods ,  Channel Capacity ,  Single Hop ,  Cluster Size Threshold ,  Packet Size ",

The Sensor Nodes (SNs) within a WSN network run on onboard batteries, which deplete over time. Therefore, increasing the length of the life span of sensors through optimizing data depletion in a cost-effective and long-lasting manner concerning energy consumption remains a difficulty. Despite its convenience, WSNs are vulnerable to a broad range of threats from both within and beyond the network, particularly attacks by insiders being particularly challenging to identify and counter. Most typically, hackers pose an insider attack on clustered WSNs by selectively discarding incoming information packets. This research presents the implementation of a Compact Crypto Authenticating Policy (CCAP) to provide highly confidential data aggregation from Member Node (MN) to Cluster Head (CH) along with from CHs to Sink Node (SiN). Intending to set up highly effective and secure paths for communication in WSNs, it takes into account the dynamics of traffic and the challenges connected with resource constraints. The proposed CCAP aims to achieve an equilibrium between energy efficiency and communication throughput, and it does so by providing a suitable cryptographic technique that guarantees safe communication. This study extends the generalization to demonstrate the viability of the proposed secured protocol for routing despite a wide range of unexpected challenges.

When witnessing most existing heuristic adaptive routing algorithms fail to address multi-objective optimization for complex traffic well, we decide to try and explore a new approach of thinking and extracting insights from network behaviors. Reinforcement learning methods have demonstrated promising opportunity applied to architecture design exploration, however not been well applied on adaptive routing design. We make the first attempt to propose a novel and comprehensive reinforcement learning framework for adaptive routing on NoCs, called RELAR. RELAR is suitable for diversified traffic patterns and resolve multi-objective optimization simultaneously. It is able to effectively isolate endpoint congestion when facing adversary hot-spot and bursty traffic, and achieve dynamic load-balancing and mitigate network congestion when meeting heavy uniform traffic. We utilize state-of-the-art high-performance interconnection benchmark, GPCNeT, as traffic generators to generate rich network congestion workloads and thus enhance online-training efficiency of RELAR. We conduct extensive experiments against state-of-the-art routing algorithms to evaluate our design. The results show that RELAR achieves 14.82% and 9.86% reduction in packet latency on average, and reduces packet latency by up to 34.24% and 16.82% under heavy synthetic traffic workload and high-performance interconnection benchmark, respectively.

The underwater networking technology for UASNs is becoming a hot research topic in recent years, where designing an appropriate routing protocol is crucial to effectively resolve the routing void, the packet delivery delay, and the energy utilization. In this paper, we propose an adaptive support-vector-machine-based routing (ASVMR) protocol in UASNs to prolong the network lifetime and reduce the end-to-end delay. The proposed protocol employs a distributed routing approach that considers all types of node state information to optimize the routing path dynamically in real-time. Moreover, a ""routing vector"" (a vector from the source to the sink node) is established, and a reasonable pipe radius is selected based on the degree of node sparsity. In addition, future states of nodes are adopted for decision-making.

How such a vehicle fleet navigate collectively through a road network is critical for ensuring sufficient spatial-temporal coverage of the sensors to meet domain-specific requirements. In this paper, we develop multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms (MARL) for centralized vehicle routing on road networks to optimize the spatial-temporal coverage. We construct an environment that is capable of incorporating user-defined weightings in a space-time domain to be covered by mobile sensing. We train the routing policy in the environment with two RL algorithms: proximal policy optimization and deep Q network in a multi-agent setting. Numerical tests on two grid networks (of sizes 20 × 20 and 30 × 30) show the proposed MARL algorithms can improve the performance by at most 56% compared with a heuristic random routing policy. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis against different fleet sizes implies that a small number of dedicated vehicles is able to approach the limit of coverage for squared road networks.

Energy Optimization and Trajectory Planning for Constrained Multi-UAV Data Collection in WSNs,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10388295/,1,Journal Article,IEEE,2024,"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) deployed in remote areas face a challenge in uploading the collected data to data centers due to limited network coverage. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can extend network coverage to remote WSNs by flying and communicating with WSN aggregator nodes to collect data. UAV-assisted data collection systems need to be carefully developed to collect all data efficiently while considering the UAV and WSN constraints. This paper provides an energy-efficient multi-UAV data collection framework for WSNs. We formulate the data collection system as a problem that jointly optimizes the system cost and energy consumption constrained by the communication power, UAV mission time, and memory size. The problem is resolved over two steps: First, the location and number of aggregators needed are determined using a triangulation-based K-means clustering that minimizes the number of aggregators used and the system cost. Second, the dockstation position that minimizes the energy consumption is obtained using the gaining-sharing knowledge (GSK) optimization algorithm. The optimum UAV trajectory for each GSK candidate solution is designed by solving a capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) that combines heuristic and metaheuristic solving techniques.

Enhancement in 6G Intelligent Network Technologies using Cognitive Radio Network,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10430814/,0,Conference Paper,IEEE,2023,"The foundational principles of emerging wireless networks such as 5G, cognitive radio, and the prospective Internet have already integrated a multitude of prerequisites from the realm of the Internet of Things (IoT). The utilization of 6G technology opens up the possibility of conducting surgeries from a remote location. The rapid and efficient transmission of medical data can be enabled by the substantial data rates, minimal latency, and viability inherent in the 6G cognitive radio network, thereby potentially elevating both the quality of healthcare and its accessibility. The enhancement of Quality of Service (QoS) crucially depends on resolving the intricacies associated with routing Secondary Users (SUs) in a multi-hop fashion. To cater to the decentralized nature of Cognitive Radio Networks (CRN) within the context of a 6G-oriented Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure, it becomes imperative to formulate solutions for routing SUs that do not hinge on cooperative mechanisms. The present routing protocols predominantly focus on defining an interference range for SUs, aimed at mitigating user interference. However, these limitations primarily consider interference with Primary Users (PUs) and do not align with the fulfillment of regulations set forth by the Federal Communication Commission (FCC). To address these challenges, a proactive method employs non-cooperative reinforcement learning techniques to systematically formulate IoT network routing strategies enhanced by 6G and cognitive radio capabilities.

Gradient Monitored Reinforcement Learning for Jamming Attack Detection in FANETs,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10419341/,0,Journal Article,IEEE,2024,"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have several military and civilian applications to perform tasks that do not require a central processing unit or human involvement. There are various vulnerable characteristics, alternatively limitations, in UAV systems such as data loss, signals interference, disabling sensors, misleading weapons, cyber attacks, disrupting services, etc. Jamming attack is one of the cyber threats that likely lead to denial of service that often occurs in wireless communication systems like Flying ad hoc networks (FANETs) and Internet of Drones (IoD). Over years, there are several approaches proposed by researchers to detect jamming attacks such as rule-based jamming attack detection mechanism, Bayesian game-theoretic mechanism, IoD-based protection mechanism, communication channel techniques (channel hopping, spectrum spreading, MIMO-based jamming mitigation, coding, etc), delay tolerant networking technique, and cryptographic algorithms, however, these methods were not suitable for jamming detection in UAV environment. The major challenges are on the delivery efficiency, processing time, accuracy, energy consumption, flight distance, and flight autonomy. In this paper, we introduce a method to detect the jamming attack using Reinforcement Learning-based Gradient Monitored (RLGM) mechanism. RLGM maintains safe regions and reduces gradient variance for intended training and this provides a better accuracy of the learning goal. In addition, RLGM achieves prompt training progress and selects precisely the series of parameters required by the network during the training phase. RLGM produces spontaneous derivation of the essential deep network scale over the training process drawing on automatically unvarying trained weights.

Reliable and Low-Latency Routing Mechanism for IoT-based Networks,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9037495/,2,Conference Paper,IEEE,2019,"Routing discovery is an essential component of the communication stack in low-power and lossy networks (LLNs). IPv6 routing protocol for LLNs, termed RPL, has been recently standardized for routing in LLNs leading to the Internet of Things (IoT) concept. RPL is designed with an assumption of gathering data towards a single destination, typically the root node. On the other hand, the arbitrary communication, where neither the source nor the destination is the root, is a prime requirement in most of LLNs-based actuating, decision making, and controlling applications. In this paper, we propose a reliable and low-latency routing mechanism based on RPL for high arbitrary communications in LLNs that is referred to herein by RL-RPL. RL-RPL utilizes the original RPL control features to guarantee backward-compatibility with RPL specifications. Using the cooja emulator as a platform, RL-RPL shows enhanced packet delivery ratio relative to the standard routing mechanism.

An Optimized Stochastic Distance Vector (OSDV) Protocol for Enhanced Energy Efficiency in Wireless Sensor Networks,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10395216/,0,Conference Paper,IEEE,2023,"In recent years, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are attracting a great deal of interest from both the business world and the academic community. WSNs are often made up of a network of Sensor Nodes (SNs), which perform various tasks, such as data collecting, interpreting, and transmitting. While batteries have been employed for powering WSNs across numerous commercial uses, their limited lifespan and cumbersome replacement need have evolved into major obstacles to the widespread adoption of WSNs. Managing energy throughout a WSN's lifecycle is crucial. In this research a new Optimized Stochastic Distance Vector (OSDV) protocol has been proposed to improve the energy efficiency of WSN using a distance metric, which is the focus of this research. To determine the Sink Node (SiN) distance, it compare the initial distance from a fixed point to the final distance needed for reaching the SiN. Data packets are sent using this protocol following an index of neighboring SN metrics. To improve the efficiency of the network, the suggested OSP prioritizes reducing energy consumption and redistributing traffic between SNs. The network's expected lifetime will increase as a result.

Traffic engineering (TE) optimizes network performance and enables optimal forwarding and routing rules to meet the quality of service (QoS) requirements for a large volume of traffic flows. This paper proposes a distributed model-free TE solution based on stochastic policy gradient reinforcement learning (RL), which aims to learn a stochastic routing policy for each router so that each router can send a packet to the next-hop router according to the learned optimal probability. The proposed policy-gradient solution naturally leads to multi-path TE strategies, which can effectively distribute the high traffic loads among all available routing paths to minimize the E2E delay.

Software-Defined Routing Strategy Based on Reinforcement Learning in Smart Power Grid,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9764077/,3,Conference Paper,IEEE,2022,"To enable a set of advanced functionalities, the smart power grid relies on pervasive sensors and actuators for continuous monitoring and control. These field devices handle both regular and event-driven (emergency) data packets, which require different levels of quality-of-service (QoS) support (latency requirements). Unfortunately, the existing routing strategies in smart power grids do not guarantee differentiated QoS support that adapts to the network dynamics. To address this limitation, we propose a QoS-aware routing strategy in smart grids based on a software-defined network (SDN). The proposed framework establishes separate queues for event-driven and fixed-scheduling packets. Then, the routing strategy is designed based on reinforcement learning to enable adaptive QoS support. In this regard, updating the routing tables at the OpenFlow switches for each incoming packet is not practical and incurs additional delays that would violate the target QoS. Instead, the proposed routing strategy relies on two Q-learning agents that fix an optimal route for each source-destination pair and update the queue service rate for each switch along the route depending on the network condition (packet arrival rate). Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed adaptive strategy offers effective QoS support compared with an SDN benchmark routing strategy based on Bellman-Ford. For instance, the average percentage of packets that violate their latency requirement is only 3% compared with at least 30% for the benchmark routing strategy.","Power Grid ,  Smart Grid ,  Routing Scheme ,  Actuator ,  Service Rate ,  Pathfinding ,  Data Packets ,  Arrival Rate ,  Latency Requirements ,  Packet Arrival ,  Center For Control ,  Time Slot ,  Average Loss ,  Low Latency ,  Model-based Approach ,  Reward Function ,  Physical Layer ,  Emergency Events ,  Average Latency ,  Packet Loss ,  Reinforcement Learning Agent ,  Packet Loss Rate ,  Phasor Measurement Units ,  Traffic Types ,  Traffic Load ,  Quality Of Service Requirements ,  Traffic Patterns ,  Power Nodes ,  Average Loss Rate ,  Routing Path ",

Intelligent Parent Change to Improve 6TiSCH Network Transmission Using Multi-Agent Q-Learning,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10609377/,0,Journal Article,IEEE,2024,"The 6TiSCH (IPv6 over the TSCH mode of IEEE 802.15.4e) architecture for wireless sensor networks merges the time-slotted channel hopping (TSCH) at the medium access control (MAC) layer with the routing protocols tailored for low-power and lossy networks (RPL). However, research often neglects the incorporation between TSCH MAC and RPL. Standard RPL strategies rely on an objective function (OF) using the expected transmission count (ETX) metric, which does not adequately reflect the traffic dynamics. Moreover, RPL’s hysteresis function employs a static threshold to control parent change decisions. This static setting disregarded the diverse traffic patterns within the network, leading to unnecessary parent node changes and preventing the node from selecting a better parent. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce 3 advancements to standard RPL. First, an adaptive parent-changing mechanism based on cooperative Q-learning. Second, a cell usage and traffic load aware objective function. Third, an improved initial transmission cell allocation. Those methods are collectively termed ACI-RPL. We evaluated the performance of the proposed method through simulations using the 6TiSCH simulator and real-hardware tests on the FIT IoT-Lab testbed with OpenWSN firmware. The experiment result indicates that ACI-RPL performs better than the benchmark algorithms.

Nevertheless, STs may cause uncertain interference to the primary receiver (PR) due to imperfect spectrum sensing, which is particularly significant when the wireless links between the primary transmitter (PT) and STs are extremely weak and the wireless links between STs and the PR are non-ignorable. This makes it difficult for the PR to select a proper modulation and/or coding scheme (MCS). To deal with the issue, we propose an intelligent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based MCS selection algorithm for the primary transmission. With the proposed algorithm, the DRL agent at the PR is able to learn the pattern of the interference from the STs and predict the interference in the future. Simulation results show that the transmission rate of the proposed algorithm can converge to 90% ^ 100% transmission rate of the optimal MCS selection algorithm, which assumes that the interference from the STs is perfectly known at the PR as prior information. Meanwhile, the transmission rate of the proposed algorithm is around 100% higher than the transmission rate of the benchmark algorithm, which selects the MCS without the information about interference.","Deep Reinforcement Learning ,  Optimization Algorithm ,  Transmission Rate ,  Spectral Bands ,  Selection Algorithm ,  Optimal Selection ,  Cognitive Networks ,  Wireless Link ,  User Pairing ,  Secondary Users ,  Deep Reinforcement Learning Agent ,  Environmental Conditions ,  State Space ,  Wireless Networks ,  Optimal Policy ,  Intelligence Algorithms ,  Reward Function ,  Channel Gain ,  Local Memory ,  Successive Phases ,  Rayleigh Fading ,  Long-term Reward ,  Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm ,  Optimal Action ,  Decision-making Scenarios ,  Symbol Error Rate ,  Transmission Frame ,  Uplink Data ,  Experience Replay ,  Previous Frame ",
Contention Window-Based MAC Protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6945737/,1,Conference Paper,IEEE,2014,"Existing duty-cycle MAC protocols for wireless sensor networks(WSNs), such as S-MAC, mostly do not consider the influence of inherent traffic distribution characteristic derived from network infrastructure, leading to significant end-to-end delivery latency and poor medium contention handling in data gathering. To mitigate these drawbacks, we propose a novel duty-cycle MAC protocol, called RL-MAC (location-based RMAC). Firstly RL-MAC exploits a location-based configuration strategy to configure nodes with un-uniform CWmin (minimum contention window) values during network initialization, in order to optimize application-level medium access fairness, avoiding packet loss and buffer overflow incurred by mismatches between un-uniform payload distribution over nodes in different position and node-level equal medium access scheme adopted by current protocols. Secondly like RMAC, RL-MAC can forward data packets over multiple hops per cycle through intermediate nodes according to cross-layer routing information, significantly reducing end-to-end delivery latency. Our simulation results obtained on ns-2 show that RL-MAC can better accommodate data gathering applications, providing high throughput and packet delivery ratio without sacrificing energy efficiency.","Wireless Sensor Networks ,  MAC Protocol ,  Energy Efficiency ,  Per Cycle ,  Network Infrastructure ,  Data Packets ,  Packet Loss ,  Medium Access ,  Packet Delivery ,  Minimum Window ,  Packet Delivery Ratio ,  Buffer Overflow ,  Configuration Scheme ,  Energy Consumption ,  Computational Details ,  Random Selection ,  Adjustment For Factors ,  Duty Cycle ,  Time Slot ,  Cycling Performance ,  Control Packets ,  Traffic Load ,  Sleep Schedule ,  Time Synchronization ,  Packet Size ,  Packet Forwarding ",
QELAR: A Machine-Learning-Based Adaptive Routing Protocol for Energy-Efficient and Lifetime-Extended Underwater Sensor Networks,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5408367/,0,Journal Article,IEEE,2010,"Underwater sensor network (UWSN) has emerged in recent years as a promising networking technique for various aquatic applications. Due to specific characteristics of UWSNs, such as high latency, low bandwidth, and high energy consumption, it is challenging to build networking protocols for UWSNs. In this paper, we focus on addressing the routing issue in UWSNs. We propose an adaptive, energy-efficient, and lifetime-aware routing protocol based on reinforcement learning, QELAR. Our protocol assumes generic MAC protocols and aims at prolonging the lifetime of networks by making residual energy of sensor nodes more evenly distributed. The residual energy of each node as well as the energy distribution among a group of nodes is factored in throughout the routing process to calculate the reward function, which aids in selecting the adequate forwarders for packets. We have performed extensive simulations of the proposed protocol on the Aqua-sim platform and compared with one existing routing protocol (VBF) in terms of packet delivery rate, energy efficiency, latency, and lifetime. The results show that QELAR yields 20 percent longer lifetime on average than VBF.","ordsRouting protocols ,  distributed networks ,  wireless communication ,  mobile communication systems. ",
An SDN-Enabled Framework for a Load-Balanced and QoS-Aware Internet of Underwater Things,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9997108/,12,Journal Article,IEEE,2023,"The massive demand for marine exploitation has promoted the thriving Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT). The volume, velocity, and variety (3V) of data produced by sensors, hydrophones, and cameras in IoUT are enormous, which challenges the network in achieving load balancing and Quality-of-Service (QoS) provisioning. This article adopts the “SDN+AI” paradigm to realize a load-balanced and QoS-aware software-defined IoUT from a framework design. We first introduce SDN technology to separate the data plane from the control plane to enhance the network’s scalability and flexibility. Then, a multicontroller load-balancing strategy based on switch migration called CASM is proposed to improve the network’s performance further. With the global view provided by SDN controllers, we proposed a QoS-aware adaptive routing protocol (SQAR) based on reinforcement learning, which can intelligently select route paths to satisfy the QoS requirements of multiple IoUT services. The results show that CASM achieves an efficient load balance while shortening the response time and average control path latency of the switch migration process, which significantly benefits our routing protocol. SQAR outperforms the existing QoS-aware routing protocols regarding QoS satisfaction probability, energy consumption, and convergence rate. Overall, our framework maintains a QoS violation rate below 5% and a load-balancing rate above 90% in a timely manner.","Load Balancing ,  Response Time ,  Convergence Rate ,  Version Of Protocol ,  Average Latency ,  Quality Of Service Requirements ,  Control Plane ,  Routing Path ,  Learning Rate ,  Softmax ,  Shortest Path ,  Flow Data ,  Adjustable Parameters ,  Time Efficiency ,  Reward Function ,  Markov Decision Process ,  Transmission Distance ,  Flow Set ,  Distributed Architecture ,  Autonomous Underwater Vehicles ,  Master Controller ,  Routing Decisions ,  Global Topology ,  Packet Delivery Ratio ,  Load Imbalance ,  Flow Table ,  Link Bandwidth ,  Energy Of Nodes ,  Temperature Coefficient ",
DRL-UTPS: DRL-Based Trajectory Planning for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles for Data Collection in Dynamic IoT Network,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9916069/,27,Journal Article,IEEE,2023,"Using highly maneuverable Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) to collect data is a fast and efficient method that is widely studied. In most studies, they assume that the UAVs can obtain the location of the Cluster Head (CH) before take-off, allocate CHs, and optimize the trajectory in advance. However, in many real scenarios, many sensing devices are deployed in areas with no basic communication infrastructure or cannot communicate with the Internet due to emergencies such as disasters. In this kind of sensing network, the surviving devices often change, and the CHs cannot be known and allocated in advance, thus bringing new challenges to the efficient data collection of the networks by using UAVs. In this paper, a UAV path planning scheme for IoT networks based on reinforcement learning is proposed. It plans hover points for UAV by learning the historical location of CHs and maximizes the probability of meeting CHs and plans the shortest UAV path to visit all hover points by using the simulated annealing method. In addition, an algorithm to search for the location of CHs is proposed which is named Cluster-head Searching Algorithm with Autonomous Exploration Pattern (CHSA-AEP). By using CHSA-AEP, our scheme enables the UAV to respond to the position change of the CHs. Finally, we compare our scheme with other algorithms (area coverage algorithms and random algorithm).

To contrast adverse and highly varying channel conditions we define a smart framework enabling nodes to acquire knowledge on the quality of the communication to neighboring nodes over time. Following a model-based reinforcement learning approach, our framework allows senders to select the best forwarding relay for its data jointly with the best communication device to reach that relay. We name the resulting forwarding method MARLIN, for MultimodAl Reinforcement Learning-based RoutINg. Applications can choose whether to seek reliable routes to the destination, or whether faster packet delivery is more desirable. We evaluate the performance of MARLIN in varying networking scenarios where nodes communicate through two acoustic modems with widely different characteristics. MARLIN is compared to state-of-the-art forwarding protocols, including a channel-aware solution, a machine learning-based solution and to a flooding protocol extended to use multiple modems.

To address these challenges, we employ a machine learning (ML)-based optimal cooperating node selection for each hop, considering the Shortest propagation delay, minimal residual Energy, and a low Collision rate (referred to as SEC). For this purpose, we initially assemble the sensor nodes to create a list of cooperative nodes, considering the aspect of SEC. Then, using an assembled list of cooperating sensor nodes, we employ ML-based algorithms, such as reinforcement learning (RL-SEC), deep Q-networks (DQN-SEC), and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG-SEC), to predict the optimal cooperating node for each hop.

In this work, we study how to realize traffic-aware configuration of all-optical DCNs in Hyper-FleX-LION. We formulate an integer linear programming (ILP) model for the problem to jointly optimize the configuration of Hyper-FleX-LION and the provisioning schemes of demands in it for minimizing its port usage. To ensure the practicalness of the optimization, we assume that each top-of-rack (ToR) switch can not only receive the traffic targeting to its rack but also forward traffic to other racks as an intermediate node. We also classifier traffic demands as normal and latency-sensitive ones, and set the maximum hop-count for routing latency-sensitive demands.

The solar-powered cognitive access points (CAPs) were deployed to improve the network performance by opportunistically allocating the primary channels to the devices for data transmissions. Firstly, we formulate the scheduling problem of long-term throughput maximization as a framework of a Markov decision process with the constraints of the minimum delay, the number of required ISM channels, and the harvested energy at the CAPs.

Reinforcement Learning for Optimal Control of Queueing Systems,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8919665/,12,Conference Paper,IEEE,2019,"With the rapid advance of information technology, network systems have become increasingly complex and hence the underlying system dynamics are typically unknown or difficult to characterize. Finding a good network control policy is of significant importance to achieving desirable network performance (e.g., high throughput or low average job delay). Online/sequential learning algorithms are well-suited to learning the optimal control policy from observed data for systems without the information of underlying dynamics. In this work, we consider using model-based reinforcement learning (RL) to learn the optimal control policy of queueing networks so that the average job delay (or equivalently the average queue backlog) is minimized. Existing RL techniques, however, cannot handle the unbounded state spaces of the network control problem. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a new algorithm, called Piecewise Decaying ε-Greedy Reinforcement Learning (PDGRL), which applies model-based RL methods over a finite subset of the state space. We establish that the average queue backlog under PDGRL with an appropriately constructed subset can be arbitrarily close to the optimal result. We evaluate PDGRL in dynamic server allocation and routing problems.

Motivated by the development of artificial intelligence, a deep reinforcement learning-based collaborative routing (DRLCR) algorithm is proposed. Both routing policy and subchannel allocation are considered jointly, aiming at minimizing the end-to-end (E2E) delay and improving the network capacity. After sufficient training by the cluster head node, the Q-network can be synchronized to each member node to select the next hop based on local observation. Moreover, we improve the performance of training by considering historical observations, which can improve the adaptability of routing policies to dynamic environments. Simulation results show that the proposed DRLCR algorithm outperforms other algorithms in terms of resource utilization and E2E delay by optimizing network load to avoid congestion.

SOMACA: A New Swarm Optimization-Based and Mobility-Aware Clustering Approach for the Internet of Vehicles,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10122916/,9,Journal Article,IEEE,2023,"The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) has evolved from the classic Vehicular Ad-hoc NETworks (VANETs) as a result of the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT). IoV is used for communication among vehicles in real-time with their drivers, other vehicles, pedestrians, fleet management systems, and roadside infrastructure. High vehicular speeds and frequent network topology changes make vehicle communication extremely difficult on the IoV network. More constraints are imposed on IoV communication performance in a huge network environment due to the difficult road conditions and the enormous quantity of vehicles. A promising approach to improve the IoV communication performance is through vehicle clustering. Minimizing the number of clusters and identifying a reliable Cluster head (CH) are some of the most challenging tasks. In this paper, we propose a Swarm optimization-based and mobility-aware clustering method termed SOMACA. SOMACA consists of two phases clustering phase and the routing phase. During the clustering phase, we combine mobility measures and cluster distance to generate the minimum number of clusters having stable CHs and employ the Sparrow Search algorithm (SSA) for CH selection. The routing phase consists of two steps (1) Route Formation and (2) Route Upkeep. The main target for route formation step is to build a secure routing path between IoV nodes and base station (BS) by establishing an optimal list of links that are ordered from high to low, and in each round, it selects the best one. Moreover, the Upkeep step aims to update and maintain the existing connection. The performance of SOMACA is assessed using simulation experiments with various metrics including average cluster lifetime, transmission range, and network grid size.

However, due to the limited radio range and scalability issues of traditional wireless sensor networks, wide-area communication among IoDs is not feasible. As a solution, a low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) is emerging as one of the techniques that can provide long-range communication with minimal power consumption. Nevertheless, the direct data transmission approach will no longer be viable due to its short network lifetime. As such, multihop data routing strategies for LPWANs are proposed in the literature. However, multihop data transmission has several challenges, including increased data latency, energy imbalance, poor bandwidth utilization, and low data throughput. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method that uses the machine learning technique for an energy-efficient and Quality-of-Service (QoS)-aware data transfer based on a recent breakthrough in social networks known as small-world characteristics (SWC).

The Catch-Up scheme is designed based on a distributed learning algorithm. Each vehicle learns from local observations and chooses a delay based on learning results. The simulation results demonstrate that our scheme can efficiently reduce the number of redundant reports and achieve a good trade-off between delay and communication overhead.","Aggregate Data ,  Adaptive Control ,  Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks ,  Learning Algorithms ,  Number Of Reports ,  Sensor Networks ,  Communication Overhead ,  Adaptive Control Scheme ,  Aggregation Scheme ,  Distributed Learning ,  Learning Process ,  Local Knowledge ,  Traffic Congestion ,  Function Approximation ,  Propagation Distance ,  Markov Decision Process ,  Reinforcement Learning Algorithm ,  Road Segments ,  Fuzzy Rules ,  Optimal Action ,  Vehicle Density ,  Markov Decision Process Model ,  Q-function ,  Traffic Information ,  Total Delay ,  Aggregation Operators ,  Ad Hoc Networks ,  State Transition Model ,  Dedicated Short Range Communication ,  Straight Road ",

Maximum End-to-End Latency Minimization in UAV-Assisted IoT Networks,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10008634/,0,Conference Paper,IEEE,2022,"With the advancement in wireless communications and smart device technologies, the Internet of Things (IoT) will make future services and applications more automatic and intelligent. However, the transmission rate and range of IoT devices are restricted by the limited battery power, which makes it challenging to provide satisfying services for delay-sensitive applications. Thanks to the high flexibility of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), we propose a UAV-assisted IoT network model, where the UAV acts as the relay to help IoT nodes transmit their packets to the access point to prevent the network from overloading. With the aim of minimizing the maximum endto-end latency, a joint UAV trajectory design and IoT device scheduling problem is formulated. As the problem cannot be formulated with explicit expressions, it is intractable to solve the problem with traditional model-driven optimization algorithms. Therefore, we adopt deep reinforcement learning to solve this problem, and propose a soft actor-critic (SAC) based algorithm for its high sampling efficiency. Numerical results demonstrate that the maximum network end-to-end latency is substantially reduced with the assistance of the UAV.

Dynamic Multihop Routing in Terahertz Flow-Guided Nanosensor Networks: A Reinforcement Learning Approach,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10021306/,4,Journal Article,IEEE,2023,"The Internet of Nano-Things (IoNT) is an emerging paradigm in which devices sized to the nanoscale (nanonodes) and transmitting in the terahertz (THz) band can become decisive actors in future medical applications. Flow-guided nanonetworks are well-known THz networks aimed at deploying the IoNT inside the human body, among other issues. In these networks, nanonodes flowing through the bloodstream monitor-sensitive biological/physical parameters and dispatch these data via electromagnetic (EM) waves to a nanorouter implanted in human tissue, which operates as a gateway to external Internet connectivity devices. Under these premises, two shortcomings arise. First, the use of the THz band greatly limits the nanonode’s communication range. Second, the nanonodes lack resources for processing, memory, and batteries. To minimize the impact of these concerns in EM nanocommunications, a novel dynamic multihop routing scheme is proposed to model in-body, flow-guided nanonetwork architecture. To this end, a reinforcement learning-based framework is conceived, combining the features of EM nanocommunications and hemodynamics or fluid dynamics applied to the bloodstream. A generic Markov decision process (MDP) approach is derived to maximize the throughput metric, analytically modeling: 1) the movement of the nanonodes in the bloodstream as laminar flow; 2) energy consumption (including energy-harvesting issues); and 3) prioritized events. A thoroughly THz flow-guided nanonetwork case of study is also defined. Under the umbrella of this case, diverse testbeds are planned to create a procedure of evaluation, validation, and discussion. Results reveal that multihop scenarios obtain better performance than direct nanonode-nanorouter communication, specifically, the two-hop scenario, which, for instance, quadrupled the throughput in a hand vein without sharply penalizing other aspects such as energy consumption.","Dynamic Routing ,  Multi-hop Routing ,  Human Tissue ,  Bloodstream ,  Energy Consumption ,  Medical Applications ,  Laminar Flow ,  Energy Harvesting ,  Dynamic Strategy ,  Markov Decision Process ,  External Devices ,  Communication Range ,  Routing Scheme ,  Nanonetwork ,  Model Analysis ,  Cardiovascular System ,  Molecular Machinery ,  Optimal Policy ,  Vein Diameter ,  Markov Decision Process Model ,  Successful Transmission ,  Dynamic Path ,  Parabolic Profile ,  Effects Of Different Types ,  Coverage Range ,  Ad Hoc Networks ,  Battery Level ",

Beyond Sensors: IntelliSignal’s Map-Integrated Intelligence in Traffic Flow Optimization,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10464272/,1,Journal Article,IEEE,2024,"The burgeoning growth of vehicular traffic, fuelled by rapid urbanization and an ever-expanding population, has resulted in congested road networks. Traditional and sensor-based adaptive traffic light management systems have shown commendable progress in some scenarios, but they suffer from inherent disadvantages that hinder their effectiveness and scalability. To combat these challenges, a dynamic and adaptable traffic control system is imperative to optimize traffic flow. The present paper explores the limitations of sensor-based adaptive traffic light management and advocates for integrating a novel algorithm to overcome the existing drawbacks. It proposes an intelligent traffic management algorithm called IntelliSignal that leverages the map service for fetching real-time traffic information to calculate the optimal green time and a penalty-based road selection to optimize traffic flow. The proposed IntelliSignal is designed to provide equal chances for all roads while prioritizing higher-density roads with more green time, effectively mitigating traffic congestion and improving overall transportation efficiency. It incorporates Q-learning, a reinforcement learning technique that enables the system to adapt and learn from traffic patterns. The proposed IntelliSignal’s performance is assessed through rigorous evaluations conducted on the simulation platform SUMO. The acquired results demonstrate substantial enhancements across various crucial metrics, including average waiting time, vehicle density, travel time, CO2 emissions, and queue length. Furthermore, the simulation results demonstrate that the proposed IntelliSignal algorithm exhibits a remarkable 30.52% increment in system throughput compared to the traditional approach.

The collected data is analyzed to obtain real-time situational awareness to impose certain behaviors on the vehicles. In such networked control systems, the timeliness of collected data is of critical importance to system performance, which can be quantified by the concept of Age of Information. Note that to obtain timely perception of its surroundings, each vehicle tends to sample status updates at the maximum frequency, which may congest the network due to limited communication resource. Moreover, the highly dynamic nature of vehicular network poses a great challenge in finding a reliable route for timely data forwarding. Therefore, the data collection scheme should be carefully designed to balance the timeliness of collected information and network stability.

In this article, we present “AirScope,” a mobile sensing system that employs cooperative robots to monitor the indoor air quality. Since the wireless coverage can be incomplete in some indoor areas, AirScope allows the robots to defer uploading the data to the central server by utilizing their own data buffers. In order to guarantee the timeliness of the data in the server, AirScope aims to minimize the average data latency by properly planning the routes of the robots. Such a route planning strategy has to be implemented in a distributed way since the robots that are out of wireless coverage can only make plans on their own. In addition, the cooperation of the robots is also necessary because the aggregation of the robots in a small area increases the average data latency of the other unattended areas. To solve this distributed and cooperative routing planning problem, we propose a solution based on distributed deep Q-learning (DDQL). We evaluate the system performance by simulations and real-world experiments. The results show that AirScope is effective to reduce data latency, where the proposed DDQL is 8% better than the greedy algorithm and 24% better than the random strategy.","Air Quality ,  Indoor Air ,  Deep Reinforcement Learning ,  Indoor Air Quality ,  Distributed Deep Reinforcement Learning ,  Indoor Environments ,  Service Data ,  Route Planning ,  Indoor Air Pollution ,  Central Server ,  Wireless Coverage ,  Deep Neural Network ,  Global Status ,  Time Slot ,  Access Points ,  Reward Function ,  Mobile Robot ,  Distribution Strategy ,  Cooperative Strategy ,  Adjacent Positions ,  Belief State ,  Robot Movement ,  Position Of The Robot ,  Connectivity States ,  Heuristic Strategy ,  Behavior Policy ,  Partial Observation ,  State Transition Matrix ,  Monitoring Area ,  Incomplete Coverage ",

Since random renewable energy harvesting has a detrimental effect on the energy balance of nodes in these green rechargeable wireless sensor networks (RWSN), the rational synergy between terminal-edge collaborative tasks offloading (TECTO) and network topology optimization (NTO) is of great significance for improving the sustainability. Therefore, this article presents a learning-based terminal-edge collaborative energy-efficient routing algorithm. First, a system model is developed to integrate TECTO and NTO, and the original problem is decoupled into two layers. Then, the NTO layer is aimed at quickly generating an energy-efficient network topology by variable cycle block coordinate descent method based on the greedy strategy. Finally, the TECTO layer adopts deep reinforcement learning based on the dynamic baseline to understand the energy efficiency feedback law of the NTO layer and rationally adjusts the TECTO scheme. The simulation results show that the presented algorithm can reasonably generate the network topology and TECTO scheme according to the node's energy state change and efficiently consume the renewable energy distributed in the green RWSN, which significantly enhances its sustainability.","Routing Algorithm ,  Energy-efficient Routing ,  Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks ,  Energy-efficient Routing Algorithm ,  Raw Data ,  Model System ,  Deep Learning ,  Renewable Energy ,  Energy Efficiency ,  Energy Balance ,  Network Topology ,  Energy State ,  Solar Energy ,  Energy Harvesting ,  Wireless Sensor ,  Deep Reinforcement Learning ,  Wireless Sensor Networks ,  Topology Optimization ,  Edge Server ,  Greedy Strategy ,  Sink Node ,  Optimization Problem ,  Residual Energy ,  Solar Energy Harvesting ,  Raw Sensor Data ,  Edge Computing ,  Internet Of Things ,  Solar Panels ,  Energy Consumption ,  Traffic Model ",

In these applications, a large number of wireless sensors are deployed in an environment to collect information and form network to transmit collected information to the base station or sink. Because wireless sensors have to work for a long period of time without maintenance, the energy consumption of wireless sensors has a great impact on the lifetime of wireless sensor network. To reduce and balance the energy consumption of wireless sensors, many information transmission routing approaches have been proposed. However, most of them do not consider all energy consumption factors of wireless sensors. To this end, an innovative information transmission routing approach based on Q-learning is proposed in this paper, which enables wireless sensors to adaptively select suitable neighboring sensors to achieve energy efficient information transmission in a decentralized manner.

Sensor nodes operate in an underwater environment and are powered by embedded batteries, making it very difficult to replenish power. It is thus important to efficiently improve sensor energy efficiency in UASNs and to extend the network lifetime. Clustering can effectively reduce UASN energy consumption by dividing sensor nodes into clusters; however, energy efficiency is always affected by the imbalance in energy consumption due to the unreasonable selection of cluster heads (CHs) and routes.

First, the UASN clusters are uniformly distributed using the K-means ++ algorithm. Then, a combination of clustering and reinforcement learning is applied to CH selection, which calculates the energy of intercluster data transmission when each node in the cluster is a CH based on the node’s residual energy and location and selects the appropriate CHs to equalize the energy consumption of each network node. The optimal transmission route constructed by reinforcement learning is used to select suitable nodes for relaying data for sensor nodes.

A Reinforcement-Learning-Based Opportunistic Routing Protocol for Energy-Efficient and Void-Avoided UASNs,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9777731/,25,Journal Article,IEEE,2022,"Underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs) have been used for various scenarios, such as marine exploration, and development of marine resources. However, due to the challenging underwater environment, UASNs suffers from high propagation delay, low transmission reliability and energy limitation, which pose significant obstacles to the delivery efficiency of data packets. What’s more, the sparse topology, the failure of node or link, and other factors can cause void holes, resulting in the considerable package retransmission and the low network reliability of UASNs. To this end, this paper proposed a reinforcement-learning-based opportunistic routing protocol (ROEVA) to reduce energy consumption as well as to improve the transmission reliability which also addresses the issue of void routing in underwater acoustic sensor networks. To seek optimal routing rules, a reward function based on reinforcement learning is proposed, where factors such as energy, delay, link quality, and depth information are all taken into account for appropriate routing decisions. Before forwarding the data packet, a two-hop availability checking function is defined, which can identify trap nodes and avoid routing holes. In addition, aiming to reduce packet redundancy and collisions, a waiting mechanism derived from opportunistic routing is proposed. According to the calculated Q-values, the waiting mechanism determines the priority list for packet forwarding. Evaluation results demonstrate that the proposed ROEVA protocol outperforms HHVBF, RCAR, QELAR and GEDAR in terms of energy efficiency, packet delivery ratio (PDR), average hop count, and end-to-end delay, which are analyzed by varying the number of nodes from 100 to 500.","Opportunistic Routing ,  Opportunistic Routing Protocol ,  Energy Consumption ,  Energy Efficiency ,  Sensor Networks ,  Average Count ,  Pathfinding ,  Depth Information ,  Reward Function ,  Data Packets ,  Undersea ,  Reliable Transmission ,  Packet Delivery ,  Delivery Ratio ,  Routing Decisions ,  Packet Forwarding ,  Packet Delivery Ratio ,  Hop Count ,  Shortest Path ,  Node Status ,  Sink Node ,  Packet Transmission ,  Residual Energy ,  Neighboring Nodes ,  Packet Header ,  Source Node ,  Optimal Path ,  Routing Path ,  Void Area ,  Acoustic Channel ",

The routing decision problem is modeled as a Markov decision process (MDP). The DQN is applied to solve the MDP, in which the agent is trained to select the forwarder with the highest reward as the next hop. The optimal policy for the agent is to choose a routing that balances the residual energy of different nodes while minimizing the routing distance, thereby improving the network lifetime and decreasing the average time delay. To evaluate its performance, we developed the proposed algorithm on an Aqua-Sim Next Generation (Aqua-Sim NG) platform and using the artificial intelligence (AI) framework.

An Energy-Efficient Distributed Adaptive Cooperative Routing in Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8905401/,2,Conference Paper,IEEE,2019,"Since WMSN is rich in perceptual data, complex in processing tasks and powerful in network functions, it also puts forward higher requirements for QoS of WMSN. However, since WMSN is heterogeneous and the energy distribution is not uniform, many existing routing protocols do not take energy consumption into account while ensuring QoS. Therefore, how to make energy distributed more efficiently while ensuring QoS has become a challenge. This paper proposes an energy-efficient distributed adaptive cooperative routing to guarantee QoS and balance energy consumption in WMSN. By adaptively selecting some nodes for reinforcement learning to acquire their performance knowledge of reliability and delay, an optimal alternative path can be created to ensure both the QoS and balanced energy distribution.

IoT requires a better communication network for data transmission between heterogeneous devices and an optimally deployed energy-efficient WSN. The clustering technique applied for WSN node deployment needs to be efficient; therefore, the entire architecture can obtain a better network lifetime. While clustering, the entire network is partitioned into various clusters. Moreover, the cluster head (CH) selection process also needs proper attention for achieving efficient data communication towards the sink node via selected CH and also for increasing the node reachability within the cluster. In this proposed framework, an energy efficient deep belief network (DBN) based routing protocol is developed, which achieves better data transmission through the selected path. Due to this the packet delivery ratio (PDR) gets improved. In this framework, initially, the nodes in the whole network is grouped as clusters using a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, which assigns a reward for the nodes that belong to the particular cluster. Then, the CH required for efficient data communication is selected using a Mantaray Foraging Optimization (MRFO) algorithm. The data is transmitted to the sink node via the selected CH using an efficient deep learning approach. At last, the performance of proposed deep network based routing protocol is evaluated using different evaluation metrics they are network lifetime, energy consumption, number of alive nodes, and packet delivery rate.

A promising field of application of WSNs is planet exploration, in which a continuous monitoring of the surface is necessary, to have a clear notion of planet conditions and prepare for a future manned mission. The potentially large size of the region to be monitored and the line-of-sight limitations on remote planets (for instance the Moon, as studied in the SWIPE project [1]), impose constraints on the possibility to have 1-hop sensor-sink communication.

BRATRA: Balanced Routing Algorithm With Transmission Range Adjustment for Energy Efficiency and Utilization Balance in WSNs,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9895273/,4,Journal Article,IEEE,2023,"In traditional wireless sensor networks (WSNs), packets are mainly transmitted in a multihop routing manner. The multihop transmission, however, leads to a hotspot problem in the sink connectivity area (SCA), and the overall network efficiency is reduced due to the quick battery power exhaustion of nodes in that area. This article proposes a novel balanced routing algorithm with transmission range adjustment (BRATRA) to address the network efficiency problem, including the energy efficiency and utilization issues. First, a balanced routing strategy is designed to deal with the SCA load imbalance problem. With the shortest balanced path, the amounts of forwarding packets for the nodes in the SCA and all the other intralayers become more even. From the perspective of power equilibrium in each routing path, each node then determines its accurate transmission radius according to the derived formula and performs power control to realize the even power utilization between interlayers, thereby prolonging the overall network lifetime. Performance evaluation validates that the proposed BRATRA strategy can achieve efficient power utilization in each intralayer and double the network lifetime as compared to the Dijkstra routing strategy. Additionally, it yields better power utilization fairness among nodes, and on average only 5% of battery power is unused for all network nodes, resulting in a network lifespan ten times larger than that using a conventional strategy.","Energy Efficiency ,  Energy Utilization ,  Wireless Sensor Networks ,  Transmission Range ,  Routing Algorithm ,  Balanced Routing ,  Utilization Efficiency ,  Shortest Path ,  Battery Power ,  Imbalance Problem ,  Power Utility ,  Balancing Strategy ,  Routing Scheme ,  Routing Path ,  Network Lifetime ,  Balancing Algorithm ,  Packet Forwarding ,  Load Imbalance ,  Energy Consumption ,  Power Consumption ,  Power Nodes ,  Nodes In Layer ,  Deep Reinforcement Learning ,  Routing Approach ,  Average Energy ,  Non-uniform Distribution ,  Residual Energy ,  Clustering Approach ,  Battery Capacity ,  Average Energy Consumption ",

Applying Graph Neural Network in Deep Reinforcement Learning to Optimize Wireless Network Routing,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9816354/,3,Conference Paper,IEEE,2022,"At present, the traffic in wireless sensor networks (WSN) is growing at an extremely fast speed, consuming more and more network resources. This undoubtedly affects the transmission performance of WSN. Good and efficient routing technology is one of the key technologies to solve this problem. Limited by the dynamic network state, traditional routing technology faces some problems such as performance degradation and lack of learning ability. In contrast, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), which has the ability of decision-making and online learning, has a better effect in facing the routing optimization problem. DRL can learn routing strategy online or offline through reinforcement learning mechanism and deep neural network. However, the existing routing models based on DRL use fully connected neural networks or convolutional neural networks, and cannot learn the network topology information. This will lead to the failure of the previously trained routing model in the face of a new network. Therefore, under the background that WSN nodes may fail, resulting in topology changes, this paper combines Graph Neural Network (GNN) with DRL, and proposes GRL-NET intelligent routing algorithm. The algorithm uses GNN instead of conventional neural network to construct DRL Agent. With the help of GNN, GRL-NET can not only learn the complex relationship among network topology, traffic and routing from the perspective of network topology, but also run in a network topology that has never appeared before. In order to evaluate the effect of GRL-NET, several groups of experiments were conducted under different traffic intensity.

So the energy of the neighbor node with the best QoS will deplete earlier than other nodes which will result in the reduction of network lifetime. Therefore, it is important that QoS routing protocols of WSNs be capable of efficiently balancing energy and other resources consumption throughout the network. In this paper, we proposed EQR-RL, energy-aware QoS routing protocol in WSNs using reinforcement learning. We compare the network performance of our proposed protocol with two other protocols (QoS-AODV and RL-QRP). The packet delivery ratio, average end-to-end delay and impact of the different traffic load on average end-to-end delay are investigated. Simulation results indicate the superiority of our proposed protocol over two others by considering different network traffic load and node mobility in terms of average end-to-end delay and packet delivery ratio.","Service Quality ,  Sensor Networks ,  Wireless Sensor ,  Wireless Sensor Networks ,  Quality Of Service Routing ,  Resource Consumption ,  Neighboring Nodes ,  Data Packets ,  Traffic Load ,  Mobile Nodes ,  Delivery Ratio ,  Network Lifetime ,  Packet Delivery Ratio ,  Wireless Sensor Nodes ,  Learning Rate ,  Network Topology ,  Load Balancing ,  Beginning Of The Simulation ,  Exploration Strategy ,  Routing Problem ,  Routing Table ,  Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning ,  Quality Of Service Requirements ,  Packet Header ,  Round-trip Time ,  Routing Algorithm ,  Latency Range ,  Routing Cost ,  Number Of Distance ",5.0

The primary concern in designing IoT-integrated heterogeneous WSNs is energy efficiency since nodes often operate with limited battery units. Software-defined heterogeneous WSNs integrated with the IoT provide an innovative design that can successfully handle these problems. The major concern in WSN is energy consumption by each node and the way of communication between the nodes in the form delivery ration and the reliability need to be more concentrated. This paper presents an enhanced routing method to resolve the two interrelated issues of large-scale IoT-based WSNs. Systems that address clustering and routing independently do not function well together, leading to inefficient solutions when considering energy usage and network longevity. There are several cluster-based routing algorithms for usage with homogeneous WSNs, but very few cater to heterogeneous WSNs regarding energy efficiency.

SSDWSN: A Scalable Software-Defined Wireless Sensor Networks,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10422802/,0,Journal Article,IEEE,2024,"In multi-hop wireless sensor networks (WSNs), sensors operate autonomously and make routing decisions independently. However, these devices are often located in remote or inaccessible areas and have limited energy and memory resources. As the network scales, efficient management to conserve resources and extend its lifetime becomes increasingly challenging. Software-defined WSNs (SDWSNs) offer a solution by enabling centralized control of low-power WSNs. However, continuously updating the controller with the network state generates significant traffic, resulting in energy loss, increased overhead, and reduced scalability and network lifetime. This study proposes a scalable SDWSN framework (SSDWSN) to address these challenges. The proposed approach focuses on scheduling, balanced routing, aggregation, and reducing traffic overhead caused by periodic network state updates to the controller. This paper presents the architecture of the proposed framework, along with the Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent. It also proposes two Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based learning policies, namely PPO-ATCP and PPO-NSFP. These policies are designed to efficiently utilize SDWSN network resources and accurately predict the network state by continuously monitoring the synchronized network state within the controller, taking appropriate actions, and updating the learning parameters based on reward functions. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of PPO-ATCP and PPO-NSFP in reducing controller-bound traffic overhead by 57% and 85%, respectively, while improving energy efficiency by 28% and 53% in SDWSNs. Additionally, PPO-NSFP achieved a minimum accuracy of 85% in network state prediction under different network-size scenarios.","Scalable ,  Wireless Sensor ,  Wireless Sensor Networks ,  Software-defined Wireless Sensor Networks ,  Energy Source ,  Deep Learning ,  Energy Efficiency ,  Utilization Efficiency ,  Network State ,  Optimal Policy ,  Network Resources ,  Reward Function ,  Deep Reinforcement Learning ,  Improve Energy Efficiency ,  Policy Learning ,  Memory Resources ,  Network Lifetime ,  Proximal Policy Optimization ,  Deep Reinforcement Learning Agent ,  Energy Consumption ,  Sink Node ,  Traffic Congestion ,  Received Signal Strength Indicator ,  Global Status ,  Global View ,  Network Size ,  Network Energy ,  Traffic Conditions ,  Network Energy Consumption ,  Residual Energy ",
Modeling and Performance Optimization of Wireless Sensor Network Based on Markov Chain,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9274491/,1,Journal Article,IEEE,2021,"Wireless sensor networks are usually deployed in areas with relatively harsh natural environments, and the collection node transmits data to the destination node through a multi-hop route. Therefore, how to effectively plan the transmission path is an important issue. This paper combines the unbiased gray model with the Markov chain model to establish an unbiased gray Markov chain model, and points out that the unbiased gray Markov chain model also has shortcomings in parameter selection. The particle swarm algorithm is used to improve it, and the mathematical model, calculation principle and various parameters of the particle swarm optimization algorithm are introduced, and the implementation flow chart of the particle swarm algorithm is given. Aiming at the shortcomings of the unbiased gray Markov chain model, the particle swarm algorithm and the unbiased gray Markov chain model are combined to form the particle swarm unbiased gray Markov chain model. The simulation environment and the training environment of the particle swarm unbiased grey Markov chain model were designed in the experiment. The node scheduling optimization experiment proves that the scheduling method based on the particle swarm unbiased grey Markov chain model has achieved better results in coverage and energy consumption balance than the random and shortest distance method. In the routing experiment, the experimental analysis of the node’s Q value proved the convergence of the algorithm, and compared with other protocols, it proved that the routing algorithm can effectively extend the network life cycle and achieve load balancing.","Wireless Sensor Networks ,  Energy Consumption ,  Optimization Algorithm ,  Particle Swarm ,  Shortest Distance ,  Particle Swarm Optimization ,  Optimization Experiments ,  Flowchart Of Algorithm ,  Grey Model ,  Scheduling Method ,  Routing Algorithm ,  Unbiased Model ,  Particle Swarm Algorithm ,  Hierarchical Structure ,  Forecasting ,  Simulation Experiments ,  Random Selection ,  Data Transmission ,  Wireless Networks ,  State Value ,  Particle Position ,  Residues In Sequence ,  Real-time Object ,  Reinforcement Learning Algorithm ,  Cluster Head ,  Deep Q-network ,  Ant Colony ,  Entire Network ,  Greater Volatility ,  Flight Speed ",
RCAR: A Reinforcement-Learning-Based Routing Protocol for Congestion-Avoided Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8782596/,77,Journal Article,IEEE,2019,"Underwater acoustic sensor networks (UASNs) have attracted much attention due to various aquatic applications. However, UASNs have many specific characteristics, such as high propagation delay, high packet error rate, and low bandwidth, which bring challenges to network congestion control. Furthermore, the point-to-point congestion control algorithms cannot guarantee the end-to-end optimal performance. Therefore, congestion avoidance is an important issue to be considered when designing routing protocols for UASNs. In addition, since the sensor nodes deployed underwater are powered by batteries, which are hard to be replaced or recharged, energy limitation should be taken into account as well. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement-learning-based congestion-avoided routing (RCAR) protocol to reduce the end-to-end delay and energy consumption. With the application of reinforcement learning, the protocol converges to the optimal route from the source node to the surface sink by exploring hop-by-hop. In RCAR, a reward function in reinforcement learning is defined in which congestion and energy are both considered for adequate routing decision. To accelerate the convergence of the algorithm, we introduce a dynamic virtual routing pipe with variable radius, which is related to the average residual energy of the neighbors of the sender node. Moreover, in the cross-layer-information-based RCAR protocol, an information update method based on a handshake in the MAC layer is proposed, which guarantees the optimal routing decision. The simulation results show that the proposed RCAR protocol outperforms hop-by-hop vector-based forwarding protocol (HHVBF), QELAR, and GEDAR in terms of convergence speed, energy efficiency, and end-to-end delay.","Sensor Networks ,  Acoustic Networks ,  Energy Consumption ,  Energy Efficiency ,  Average Energy ,  Neighboring Nodes ,  Bit Error Rate ,  Pathfinding ,  Reward Function ,  Source Node ,  Propagation Delay ,  Residual Energy ,  Dynamic Routing ,  Routing Decisions ,  Application Of Reinforcement Learning ,  Variable Radius ,  Information Exchange ,  Local Information ,  Dense Network ,  Energy Distribution ,  Sink Node ,  Packet Forwarding ,  Communication Range ,  Packet Delivery Ratio ,  Optimal Policy ,  Packet Transmission ,  Constant Cost ,  Initiation Phase ,  Undersea ,  Buffer State ",
Network-Lifetime Maximization of Wireless Sensor Networks,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7322190/,45,Journal Article,IEEE,2015,"Network lifetime (NL) maximization techniques have attracted a lot of research attention owing to their importance for extending the duration of the operations in the battery-constrained wireless sensor networks (WSNs). In this paper, we consider a two-stage NL maximization technique conceived for a fully-connected WSN, where the NL is strictly dependent on the source node's (SN) battery level, since we can transmit information generated at the SN to the destination node (DN) via alternative routes, each having a specific route lifetime (RL) value. During the first stage, the RL of the alternative routes spanning from the SN to the DN is evaluated, where the RL is defined as the earliest time, at which a sensor node lying in the route fully drains its battery charge. The second stage involves the summation of these RL values, until the SN's battery is fully depleted, which constitutes the lifetime of the WSN considered. Each alternative route is evaluated using cross-layer optimization of the power allocation, scheduling and routing operations for the sake of NL maximization for a predetermined per-link target signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio values. Therefore, we propose the optimal but excessive-complexity algorithm, namely, the exhaustive search algorithm (ESA) and a near-optimal single objective genetic algorithm (SOGA) exhibiting a reduced complexity in a fully connected WSN. We demonstrate that in a high-complexity WSN, the SOGA is capable of approaching the ESA's NL within a tiny margin of 3.02% at a 2.56 times reduced complexity. We also show that our NL maximization approach is powerful in terms of prolonging the NL while striking a tradeoff between the NL and the quality of service requirements.","Sensor Networks ,  Wireless Sensor Networks ,  Optimization Algorithm ,  Service Quality ,  Alternative Route ,  Battery Charging ,  Specific Routes ,  Quality Of Service Requirements ,  Network Lifetime ,  Battery Level ,  Exhaustive Search Algorithm ,  Computational Complexity ,  Low Complexity ,  Random Selection ,  Network Topology ,  Additive Noise ,  Bit Error Rate ,  Bit Error ,  Candidate Solutions ,  Battery Capacity ,  Distinct Routes ,  Signal-to-interference-plus-noise Ratio ,  Quadrature Phase Shift Keying ,  Crossover Operator ,  Genetic Operators ,  Route Selection ,  Transmission Phase ,  Single Route ,  Routing Information ,  Routing Algorithm ",

A Routing Algorithm for Underwater Acoustic– Optical Hybrid Wireless Sensor Networks Based on Intelligent Ant Colony Optimization and Energy-Flexible Global Optimal Path Selection,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10502320/,0,Journal Article,IEEE,2024,"Due to the increasing demand for oceanic exploration, routing algorithms in underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) have garnered widespread research interest. However, the majority of current routing algorithms only use a single transmission medium and consider the information from merely one or two hops when selecting relay nodes, thereby attaining limited achievement of globally optimal path selection. To address these issues, in this article, we propose a routing algorithm for underwater acoustic–optical hybrid wireless sensor networks based on intelligent ant colony optimization and energy-flexible (IAEF) global optimal path selection. Given the diverse energy-consumption characteristics of acoustic and optical waves, the proposed IAEF algorithm uses acoustic waves in seeking optimal path and optical waves in delivering data packets. In contrast to other routing algorithms based on ant colony techniques, the proposed IAEF algorithm enables source nodes to select the optimal path for data transmission with the heuristic factor updated according to a comprehensive consideration on remained energy and transmission deviation angle. Considering the limited energy in networks, the proposed IAEF algorithm designs an energy classification network update mechanism with flexible cycles, which enables network updates according to an adjustable energy threshold for the nodes along the optimal path. In addition, a protection period is implemented to prevent excessive network updates to improve packet delivery rate (PDR) and network lifetime. Simulation results exhibit that the proposed IAEF algorithm can obtain up to about 37% and 78% improvements in PDR and network lifetime when compared with the classical routing algorithms adopted in the simulations.","Optical Sensors ,  Optimal Selection ,  Sensor Networks ,  Ant Colony ,  Optimal Path ,  Wireless Sensor Networks ,  Ant Colony Optimization ,  Optical Networks ,  Routing Algorithm ,  Path Selection ,  Intelligent Optimization ,  Global Path ,  Optical Hybrid ,  Optimal Path Selection ,  Global Optimal Path ,  Data Transmission ,  Acoustic Waves ,  Angle Difference ,  Data Packets ,  Source Node ,  Network Energy ,  Energy Consumption ,  Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning ,  Periodic Updates ,  Undersea ,  Residual Energy ,  Reduce Energy Consumption ,  Acoustic Sensors ,  Sink Node ,  Energy Of Nodes ",

In this paper, optimal control policy is devised based on minimum-delay transmission in a multi-hop EH-WSN using reinforcement learning (RL). The WSN consists of M EH sensor nodes aiming to transmit their data to a sink node with a minimum delay. Each sensor node is equipped with a battery of limited capacity to save the harvested energy and a data buffer of limited size to store both the sensed and relayed data from neighboring nodes. Centralized and distributed RL algorithms are considered for EH-WSNs. In the centralized RL algorithm the control action is taken at a central unit using the state information of all sensor nodes. In the distributed RL algorithm the control action is taken locally at each sensor node using its state of information and the state information of neighboring nodes.

Reinforcement Learning for Delay Tolerance and Energy Saving in Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10049537/,5,Journal Article,IEEE,2023,"Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for improving the performance of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The Q-learning technique is one approach of RL in which the algorithm continuously learns by interacting with the environment, gathering information to take certain actions. It maximizes performance by determining the optimal result from that environment. In this paper, we propose a data gathering algorithm based on a Q-learning approach named Bounded Hop Count - Reinforcement Learning Algorithm (BHC-RLA). The proposed algorithm uses a reward function to select a set of Cluster Heads (CHs) to balance between the energy-saving and data-gathering latency of a mobile Base Station (BS). In particular, the proposed algorithm selects groups of CHs to receive sensing data of cluster nodes within a bounded hop count and forward the data to the mobile BS when it arrives. In addition, the CHs are selected to minimize the BS tour length. Extensive experiments by simulation were conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm against another traditional heuristic algorithm. We demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing work in the mean of the length of a mobile BS tour and a network’s lifetime.","Sensor Networks ,  Wireless Sensor Networks ,  Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks ,  Learning Algorithms ,  Wireless Networks ,  Heuristic Algorithm ,  Reward Function ,  Cluster Nodes ,  Reinforcement Learning Algorithm ,  Data Nodes ,  Mobile Base Stations ,  Hop Count ,  Energy Consumption ,  Maximum Distance ,  Line Segment ,  Parts Of The Tree ,  Residual Energy ,  Set Of Sensors ,  Transmission Range ,  Nearest Neighbor Algorithm ,  Network Lifetime ,  Number Of Sensor Nodes ,  Routing Path ,  Subset Of Nodes ,  Star Symbol ,  Algorithm In This Paper ,  Merging Clusters ,  Relay Nodes ,  Maximum Reward ",

The Detection Scheme Against Selective Forwarding of Smart Malicious Nodes With Reinforcement Learning in Wireless Sensor Networks,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9777986/,7,Journal Article,IEEE,2022,"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are extremely vulnerable to different attacks because of open communication, and distribution in unattended areas. The selective forwarding attack is one of the most difficult inside attacks to be detected for two reasons. The node in a harsh environment has to drop some data packets, and the smart malicious node frequently eludes detection. In this paper, we model a selective forwarding attack of smart malicious nodes with a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm. To effectively detect the selective forwarding attack under a harsh environment, we design the double-threshold density peaks clustering (DT-DPC) algorithm. Abnormal nodes are identified as malicious and isolated owing to continuous abnormalities. Suspicious nodes are determined by the neighbor voting method because malicious behaviors show up separately and a harsh environment universally disturbs agglomerate nodes. Even if smart malicious nodes elude the detection by an RL algorithm, DT-DPC improves the network throughput. The simulation results show that DT-DPC has a low false detection rate (FDR) of around 1% and a missed detection rate (MDR) of around 10%.

In large-scale SDN-IoT networks, there is a requirement for routing protocols that are both efficient and secure in order to ensure a superior level of quality of service (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE). To address the above stated challenges, a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) known as DQQS model is proposed.

WLARS: Workload-Aware Recharge Scheduling Mechanism for Improving Surveillance Quality in Wireless Rechargeable Sensor Networks,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10103824/,1,Journal Article,IEEE,2023,"With radio frequency (RF), the mobile charger (MC) can wirelessly transmit energy to the sensor nodes in the network. The wireless energy transfer enhances the lifetime of sensor nodes in wireless rechargeable sensor networks (WRSNs). Most of the studies improved the efficiency of MC or perpetuated the lifetime of WRSNs. At the same time, none of the studies focused on considering the spatial and temporal surveillance qualities (STSQs) of each sensor recharged. Therefore, this article proposed an efficient energy recharge scheduling for MC, aiming to maximize the STSQ of the given network. Initially, sensor routing load (RL) is considered to partition the network to distribute the charging load of the MCs evenly.

The proposed independent gradient forward (IGF) proves that the Euclidean equation used by greedy forwarding is less capable of dealing with the problems mentioned above. IGF considers each dimension independently to enhance the efficiency of greedy forwarding, sustaining its simplicity. It contributes to strengthening the suggested IGF's ability to manage holes and get around obstructions in the wireless sensor network. We have demonstrated that it travels a shorter potential path and avoids stuck nodes well in advance. It is more energy-efficient since it can predict the void node and never visits a stalled node. We evaluated the suggested IGF's performance against other traditional boundary traversal-based methods on both rare and dense networks. In comparison with other boundary traversal-based algorithms, the simulation results indicate that it generates a 10% smaller route to bypass.

Traditional intrusion detection methods analyze and identify attacks such as Denial of Service, anomaly detection, wormhole, sybil, and blackhole. Traditional methods never addressed the application layer's novel attack, such as the delete attack. Unique DELETE attack (DA) forms in the application layer and targets web servers and applications. Since unique DA use uniform resource locator requests, distinguishing them from legitimate traffic becomes difficult. The unique DA classify as unique (or) single, multiple, and repeated unique DELETE attacks; for detecting the unique DA types, gradient thresholding-long short-term memory (GT-LSTM) algorithm is proposed using packet per second and traffic rate data in WSN nodes. GT-LSTM algorithm detects unique DA through different thresholding at the training option layer in LSTM.

Early warning and alert of such events will help for preparedness to avoid human and economic causalities. Managing a disaster or emergency scenario is a difficult endeavor. These episodes of mass devastation, whether caused by natural disasters or man-made disasters, result in massive losses of money, property, and lives as a result of inadequate response by the government and management authorities. As a result, actions must be taken to avoid these circumstances from occurring by discovering the causes of these catastrophes in advance and providing swift rescue procedures once the crisis happens. In a disaster situation, communication plays a vital role, and a lot of people turn towards it as a source of information conveyance/delivery for controlling the situation. Even these communication networks are damaged and incur tremendous losses during disasters. All the communication networks, including mobile wireless sensor networks (WSNs) deployed for communication, also suffer huge damage and face many challenges during disasters.

Alternatively, due to magnetic permeability of soil being similar to air, magnetic induction- (MI-) based approach was adopted using magnetic coils as antenna for sensor nodes. Subsequently, MI waveguide and 3D coil mechanisms were considered to improve the system efficiency. Attributing to different characteristics of underlying transmission channels, communication protocols as well as architecture of MI-based WUSNS (MI-WUSNs) have been developed with different approaches. In this review paper, in addition to the latest advancements made for MI-WUSNs, closely associated areas of MI-WUSNs have also been explored.

So end-to-end delay is an important performance metric in wireless sensor networks. Opportunistic routing protocols have been proposed to reduce the waiting delay. In the duty cycle networks, increasing the duty cycle ratio can also reduce the end-to-end delay. However, this method will consume more energy. It is obvious that there exists a trade-off between delay and energy consumption. So adjusting the duty cycle ratio of each node can investigate this trade-off.

An energy aware cluster-based routing and adaptive semi-synchronized MAC for energy harvesting WSN,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dac.5202,1,RESEARCH ARTICLE,Wiley,2022,"Medium access control (MAC) layer scheduling is an intelligent solution to protract the lifetime of energy harvesting wireless sensor network (WSN) which is challenging issue in recent times. Self-adaptive MAC protocol was working upon reinforcement learning. However, this decentralized adaptive scheduling introduces collisions and degrades the overall network performance. To fix this problem, this paper proposes novel semi-synchronized MAC approach for energy harvesting WSN. The major objective of this work is to improve energy efficiency of the network by minimizing energy consumption which is the major issue in WSN. Proposed WSN network is modeled with dual mobile sinks with circular moving path and static sensor nodes to monitor the environment. Our novel MAC approach is initiated with unequal cluster formation by correlation based unequal clustering scheme in which multi-objective elephant herding optimization (CUC-MEHO) algorithm is incorporated for cluster head (CH) selection. In clustered network, all sensor nodes follow semi-synchronized adaptive active period MAC scheduling (S2A2MAC) protocol. In this work, S2A2MAC operates upon hidden Markov model (HMM) which controls the active time period of a node in an adaptive manner. Energy efficient hop-by-hop intra-cluster routing is empowered by Bayes rule enabled perfect matching (BR-PM) algorithm. Before route selection, all candidate nodes are regarded into perfect match, partially match, and no match nodes. Furthermore, emergency data is identified by CH based on flag value and transmitted without any time delay. For emergency data transmission, extremity aware routing (EAR) algorithm is presented and EAR algorithm is functioning on hopcount and distance criteria. Finally, proposed network is evaluated by extensive simulations in NS-3.26.

On-Demanding Information Acquisition in Multi-UAV-Assisted Sensor Network: A Satisfaction-Driven Perspective,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2021/2717733,1,Research Article,Wiley,2021,"When multiple heterogeneous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) provide service for multiple users in sensor networks, users’ diverse priorities and corresponding priority-related satisfaction are rarely concerned in traditional task assignment algorithms. A priority-driven user satisfaction model is proposed, in which a piecewise function considering soft time window and users’ different priority levels is designed to describe the relationship between user priority and user satisfaction.

By harvesting energy from the surrounding environment, sensors in EHWSN remove the energy constraint and have an unlimited lifetime in theory. The long-lasting character makes EHWSN suitable for Industry 4.0 applications that usually need sensors to monitor the machine state and detect errors continuously.

Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) is a network of underwater objects that enables monitoring subsea environment remotely. Underwater Wireless Sensor Network (UWSN) is the main enabling technology for IoUT. UWSNs are characterised by the limitations of the underlying acoustic communication medium, high energy consumption, lack of hardware resources to implement computationally intensive tasks and dynamic network topology due to node mobility. These characteristics render UNWSNs vulnerable to different attacks, such as Wormhole, Sybil, flooding, jamming, spoofing, and Denial of Service attacks. This article reviews peer-reviewed literature that addresses the security challenges and attacks on UWSNs as well as possible mitigative solutions. Findings show that the biggest contributing factors to security threats in UWSNs are the limited energy supply, the limited communication medium and the harsh underwater communication conditions. Researchers in this field agree that the security measures of terrestrial wireless sensor networks are not directly applicable to UWSNs due to the unique nature of the underwater environment where resource management becomes a significant challenge.

Because they transmit their packet and forward the outer sub-regions packet to the sink. Hence, a hole arises near the sink node after a very short time. Thus, an energy-aware optimal routing model is introduced in this research using Modified Voronoi-assisted prioritized double deep Q-learning (PDDQL). Initially, the sensor nodes are deployed using the Voronoi cell structure that splits the entire region of interest into different Voronoi polygons. However, the Voronoi diagram will not always predict an efficient route because of the nodes at a Voronoi edge or vertex outside the transmission range. To tackle this issue, a new Voronoi diagram is proposed that depends on the maximum horizontal transmission range to remove the portion of Voronoi edges uncovered by the sensor node. After the deployment, a PDDQL algorithm is used to select the Relay Nodes based on their remaining energy. The proposed PDDQL determines an alternate route to transmit the packet if an energy hole problem has occurred in WMSN. The analysis of a proposed routing protocol based on the assessment measures like packet delivery ratio, average residual energy, number of alive nodes, and average end-to-end delay accomplished the value of 198.33 (ms), 2.05 (J), 100, and 0.85, respectively.",none,
Link-delay and spectrum-availability aware routing in cognitive sensor networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1049/iet-com.2019.0994,4,Research Article,Wiley,2020,"This study designs and presents routing protocols multi-channel, multi-hop cognitive radio sensor network (CRSN), which are based on spectrum sensing, spectrum-availability analysis and per-hop delay analysis. In order to cope with the spectrum dynamics in the CRSNs, a framework is proposed to estimate the remaining duration of spectrum availability which is based on the expected idle length of channels, sensing period and communication history on the channel. Such methodology allows cognitive users to mitigate communication interruptions caused by arrivals of primary users, thus to improve the transmission performance over each hop. In particular, in combination with the per-hop delay analysis, the routing paths from sources to the sink can be established such as they provide the shortest delay opportunistically or shorter delay but reliable communication along the selected paths.

An enhanced MSU-TSCH scheduling algorithms for industrial wireless sensor networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpe.7938,none,RESEARCH ARTICLE,Wiley,2023,"The reliability and latency requirements of wireless sensor network-based smart grid communications are met in large part by MAC protocols. Developed by IEEE, time slotted channel hopping (TSCH), a method that is effective, dependable, and predictable. However, the TSCH standard does not enable mobility and does not offer any solution for scheduling, especially in IEEE 802.15.4 TSCH, the most recent generation of extremely dependable and low-power MAC protocols. Recently, MSU-TSCH a time-frequency communication schedule was proposed to provide mobility to TSCH. Despite its distinctive qualities, MSU-TSCH has the drawback of computing the TSCH schedule at each node independently of its traffic load, which can significantly increase the communication delay. Due to this limitation, MSU-TSCH is not suitable for some delay-sensitive smart grid applications. In this article, we provide an improved MSU-TSCH-based TSCH protocol, called Mobility-TSCH, that dynamically adjusts time slot assignments based on traffic volume and latency requirement. Moreover, the protocol Mobility-TSCH adapts to topology changes and supports mobility. Additionally, it optimizes time slot allocation by prioritizing nodes closest to the sink.

Traffic and Energy Aware Optimization for Congestion Control in Next Generation Wireless Sensor Networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2021/5575802,23,Research Article,Wiley,2021,"Congestion in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is an unavoidable issue in today’s scenario, where data traffic increased to its aggregated capacity of the channel. The consequence of this turns in to overflowing of the buffer at each receiving sensor nodes which ultimately drops the packets, reduces the packet delivery ratio, and degrades throughput of the network, since retransmission of every unacknowledged packet is not an optimized solution in terms of energy for resource-restricted sensor nodes. Routing is one of the most preferred approaches for minimizing the energy consumption of nodes and enhancing the throughput in WSNs, since the routing problem has been proved to be an NP-hard and it has been realized that a heuristic-based approach provides better performance than their traditional counterparts. To tackle all the mentioned issues, this paper proposes an efficient congestion avoidance approach using Huffman coding algorithm and ant colony optimization (ECA-HA) to improve the network performance. This approach is a combination of traffic-oriented and resource-oriented optimization. Specially, ant colony optimization has been employed to find multiple congestion-free alternate paths. The forward ant constructs multiple congestion-free paths from source to sink node, and backward ant ensures about the successful creation of paths moving from sink to source node, considering energy of the link, packet loss rate, and congestion level. Huffman coding considers the packet loss rate on different alternate paths discovered by ant colony optimization for selection of an optimal path.

Hybrid localization scheme using K-fold optimization with machine learning in WSN,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dac.5206,5,RESEARCH ARTICLE,Wiley,2022,"Node localization technology can identify and track nodes, making observing data more relevant; for example, information received at the sink node would be useless to the client if node localization data from the sensor region were not included. Localization is described as determining the location of unknown sensor nodes named destination nodes applying the recognized location of anchor nodes based on measurements such as time difference of occurrence, time of occurrence, angle of occurrence, triangulation, and maximum probability. The purpose of node localization is to assign coordinates points to all sensor nodes arbitrarily put in the monitoring region and have an unknown location. Localization of nodes is essential to account for the cause of events that help group sensor querying, routing, and network coverage. In this paper, data transmission among the nodes is done by comparing the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) value with the supervised learning value. If the RSSI value is less than the supervised learning value, the data transmission takes place; else, no transmission. This paper proposes a hybrid localization scheme that effectively uses K-fold optimization with supervised learning and gives good results for distance error and RSSI/energy efficiency.

Social sensing-based duty cycle management for monitoring rare events in wireless sensor networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1049/iet-wss.2013.0125,6,Research Articles,Wiley,2015,"This paper introduces a social sensing-based dynamic duty cycle management scheme, namely probabilistic duty cycle in sensor medium access control (PDC-SMAC) protocol, for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The objective of PDC-SMAC is to minimise energy consumption in monitoring ‘rare events’ by reducing the period of ‘ineffective sensing’. Ineffective sensing is defined as event monitoring or sensing, even if there is no event to monitor or sense. Existing schemes suffer from unnecessary energy consumption because of ineffective sensing. For example, the period and frequency of occurrence of an event in military applications is unpredictable, and sometimes the delay between two consecutive occurrences is very large. We exploit the social sensing behaviour of social networks for avoiding ineffective sensing by managing the duty cycle of a node in a sensor network. PDC-SMAC minimises the energy consumption of a WSN as the event monitoring overhead is accounted for by the social network. Simulation results show that PDC-SMAC consumes 37% less energy in an ideal environment and 15% less energy on overall performances as compared with the benchmark considered for comparison.

On that account, the conjunction of wireless body area networks (WBAN) and Internet of Things (IoT) for healthcare and medical diagnosis has become really important, and is accordingly one of the most popular and attractive areas of the Internet of Things (IoT). In such an IoT, a wireless body area network (WBAN) consists of a miniature sample of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) that can be either implanted in the human body or wearable. Nowadays, IoT has made healthcare evaluation possible.

Toward Performant and Energy-Efficient Network Queries: A Parallel and Stateless Approach,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2023/6185758,none,Research Article,Wiley,2023,"In many edge computing applications (e.g., wireless sensor networks, WSNs) where nodes are mostly battery-powered, queries’ energy consumption, and response time are two of the most important metrics, representing the network’s sustainability and performance, respectively. Conventional techniques used to focus on only one of the two metrics and did not attempt to optimize both in a coordinated manner. This work aims to achieve both high sustainability and high performance of these queries at the same time. To that end, a new mechanism is proposed to construct the topology of a three-tier WSN. The proposed mechanism eliminates the conventional stateful routing tables and employs a stateless and efficient addressing scheme inspired by the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT). The CRT-based topology allows for query parallelism, an unprecedented feature in the WSNs. On top of the new topology encoded by CRT, a new protocol is designed to parallelly preprocess collected data on sensor nodes by effectively aggregating and deduplicating data in a cluster of neighborhood nodes. At the same time, the hibernating mechanism is proposed to prolong the network life cycle. Moreover, a new algorithm is devised to allow the queries and results to be transmitted through low-power and fault-tolerant paths using recursive elections over a subset of the entire power range. With all these new techniques taken together, the system presented in this work outperforms approximate algorithms from various perspectives: (i) the query response is improved by up to 21.6%; (ii) the energy consumption is reduced by up to 16.8%; and (iii) the reliability is increased by up to 18.3%.",none,

Selection of Optimal Deployment and Routing Configurations in Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks for Avoiding Energy Holes,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2019/3597304,3,Research Article,Wiley,2019,"Improving the energy efficiency of underwater acoustic sensor networks (UW-ASNs) is a crucial issue due to the reduced and nonrechargeable energy resource of the underwater sensor nodes. In this work, we address the energy sink hole problem in UW-ASNs while considering the unique and harsh characteristics of the underwater channel. Our goal is to determine the optimal deployment and routing settings that surmount the energy sink hole problem and hence maximize the network lifetime. We prove that sensors can evenly consume their initial battery power provided that first they adjust their transmission power when they transmit the route through traffic and second they are appropriately placed while deployed. Mainly, we propose a deployment scheme and the corresponding balanced routing strategy that lead to uniform energy consumption among all underwater sensors subject to a predefined reliability level at the sink. Specifically, we look for the optimal deployment settings especially in terms of nodes’ separation distances that help achieving uniform energy consumption in the network while satisfying the application requirement especially in terms of desired information reliability. Jointly, at the routing layer, we assume that each sensor is provided with the possibility of dynamically adjusting its transmission power up to a given number of levels N. To this goal, we mainly deal with two main cases: fixed and variable nodes separation distance. For the fixed case, we suppose that any two successive nodes in the network are equally spaced, and we strive for deriving the optimal distance as well as the optimal number of transmission power levels along with optimal load weight corresponding to every possible transmission power level for every sensor node. For the variable case, we deal with two subcases: first, we suppose that the distance separating successive nodes follows an arithmetic progression, and second, we assume that the distance separating successive nodes is following a geometric sequence.

Reliable transmission scheduling for multi-channel wireless sensor networks with low-cost channel estimation,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1049/iet-com.2010.1008,9,Article,Wiley,2013,"The shared-medium nature and complex wireless environment of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) poses fundamental challenges to the design of effective transmission scheduling algorithms that are optimised with respect to superframe length and reliability. In this study, the authors propose an adaptive and reliable transmission scheduling algorithm for WSNs based on low-cost estimation of channel states. The authors establish a hierarchical scheduling framework on global centralised timeslot scheduling and local distributed channel scheduling. On the one hand, global centralised timeslot scheduling aims to guarantee global optimality of resource allocation, during which a mathematical reliability model is built to avoid resource waste by the stationary allocation method and improve the reliability of packet transmission. On the other hand, local distributed channel scheduling shares the responsibility of resource allocation. During channel scheduling, the channel model is constructed by the dynamic programming method and takes both probing cost and channel quality into consideration, which alleviates the uncertain and time-varying interference and overcomes the blindness of traditional methods. In contrast with previous works that do not consider link reliability and channel probing cost and often assume two channel states, the scheduling algorithm performs reliably for an arbitrary number of channels and arbitrary number of channel states. Extensive simulations and experiments under a variety of network environments have been conducted to validate our theoretical claims.",none,
Joint load balanced stable routing and communication segment assignment in mobile cognitive radio ad-hoc networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dac.3710,4,RESEARCH ARTICLE,Wiley,2018,"The fundamental issues in mobile cognitive radio ad-hoc networks are the selection of the optimal stable paths between nodes and proper assignment of the frequency channels/time slots (communication segments) to the links. In this paper, a joint load balanced stable routing and communication segment assignment algorithm is proposed that considers jointly the mobility prediction, mitigating the co-channel interference and energy consumption. The novelty of the proposed algorithm lies in the increasing of the path stability, which benefits from the maximum link lifetime parameter and introduced weighting function to keep routes away from the PU's region. This avoids the negative impacts on the PUs' operations and decreases the conflict of the cognitive nodes. In the proposed algorithm, the concept of load balancing is considered that yields in the balancing energy consumption in the network, improving the network performance and distributing traffic loads on all available channels. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified by evaluating the aggregate interference energy, average end-to-end delay, goodput, and the energy usage per packet under 6 scenarios.

Application communication relates to the acquisition of sensed data from a specific area and network connectivity that concerns the reliable delivery of the observed data from sensor nodes to the sink node. The analytical evaluation of ACR involves two steps: first identifying all the K -coverage sets, and then evaluating the communication reliability of delivering the observed data from sensor nodes within the identified K -coverage sets to the sink node. Two single-path routing algorithms, shortest-path distance algorithm and shortest-path hop algorithm, are considered for evaluating the communication reliability during the second step. Their performances in terms of ACR and energy consumptions are compared through an empirical analysis of several examples. Results show that WSNs using the shortest-path distance algorithm are more reliable than those using the shortest-path hop algorithm in most cases, but consume more energy for delivering the sensed data to the sink node.

Despite the network infrastructure’s simplicity, it faces issues such as changeable connection capacity, dynamic topology, node battery power exhaustion, and inadequate physical security. Broadcasting is a standard MANET approach for sending messages from a source node to all other nodes in the network. Flooding is a frequent method for broadcasting route request (RREQ) packets, which is susceptible to broadcast storms. The high retransmission rate is caused by the standard flooding technique, which causes media congestion and packet collisions, which can drastically reduce throughput and network performance. In a mobile ad-hoc network, efficient broadcasting focuses on selecting a compact forward node set while assuring broadcast coverage. The goal is to find a limited number of forward nodes that will provide complete coverage. In this paper, we propose an optimized and energy-efficient routing protocol for MANET (mobile ad-hoc network) based on dynamic forwarding probability in general and AODV (ad hoc on-demand distance vector) in particular, in which the route request packets are randomly controlled to increase the network lifetime and reduce packet loss in the flooding algorithm.

This class of routing technique is generally designed for large-scale networks. It aims to efficiently increase network lifetime by cutting the whole network into clusters. However, traditional clustering techniques show some limitations and do not take into consideration the self-organized with dynamic topology inherent in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). These limitations can lead to an unbalanced cluster head distribution that affects the whole network energy consumption.

Heuristic Localization Algorithm with a Novel Error Control Mechanism for Wireless Sensor Networks with Few Anchor Nodes,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2018/5190543,3,Research Article,Wiley,2018,"A novel iterative localization algorithm with high accuracy and low anchor node dependency for large-scale wireless sensor networks is proposed in this paper. At each iteration, blind nodes are located using a weighted linear least squares-based algorithm. To prevent errors in the blind nodes from propagating and accumulating throughout the network, an anchor geometric feature-based error control mechanism is used to select the nodes that participate in the localization and to estimate the localization confidence. The simulation results show that the algorithm can be used when only a few anchor nodes are involved. This algorithm is more advanced than traditional methods, which often require a large number of well-placed anchor nodes to operate appropriately. By optimizing the decision parameter v of the algorithm, the average localization error of the algorithm is approximately 0.43 meters. When the ratio of anchor nodes (the ratio of the number of anchor nodes to the number of sensor nodes in the network) is 1.25% (i.e., 5 anchor nodes for 400 sensor nodes), the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) variance is 8 dBm, and the radio range is 50 meters. A comparison of the proposed algorithm with global localization methods, including multidimensional scaling (MDS), semidefinite programming (SDP), and shortest-path access (SPA), shows that the proposed algorithm achieves higher location accuracy and stability when the number of anchor nodes is varied.

FAPRP: A Machine Learning Approach to Flooding Attacks Prevention Routing Protocol in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2019/6869307,19,Research Article,Wiley,2019,"Request route flooding attack is one of the main challenges in the security of Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) as it is easy to initiate and difficult to prevent. A malicious node can launch an attack simply by sending an excessively high number of route request (RREQ) packets or useless data packets to nonexistent destinations. As a result, the network is rendered useless as all its resources are used up to serve this storm of RREQ packets and hence unable to perform its normal routing duty. Most existing research efforts on detecting such a flooding attack use the number of RREQs originated by a node per unit time as the threshold to classify an attacker. These algorithms work to some extent; however, they suffer high misdetection rate and reduce network performance. This paper proposes a new flooding attacks detection algorithm (FADA) for MANETs based on a machine learning approach. The algorithm relies on the route discovery history information of each node to capture similar characteristics and behaviors of nodes belonging to the same class to decide if a node is malicious. The paper also proposes a new flooding attacks prevention routing protocol (FAPRP) by extending the original AODV protocol and integrating FADA algorithm. The performance of the proposed solution is evaluated in terms of successful attack detection ratio, packet delivery ratio, and routing load both in normal and under RREQ attack scenarios using NS2 simulation. The simulation results show that the proposed FAPRP can detect over 99% of RREQ flooding attacks for all scenarios using route discovery frequency vector of sizes larger than 35 and performs better in terms of packet delivery ratio and routing load compared to existing solutions for RREQ flooding attacks.",none,

Enhanced clustering based routing protocol in vehicular ad-hoc networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1049/els2.12069,2,ORIGINAL RESEARCH,Wiley,2023,"A vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) is derived from a mobile ad-hoc network that is a part of less infrastructure network design. Vehicular communication in VANET can be achieved using vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. A vehicle communicates with other vehicles through onboard units while communicating with roadside units in an infrastructure mode. Secure clustering is required for the communication between nodes in the whole network. The fundamental problem with the VANET is the instability of the network that occurs due to vehicles' mobile nature, which decreases the network's efficiency. This research proposes an enhanced cluster-based lifetime protocol ECBLTR that focuses on maximising the network's stability of routing and average throughput. The Sugeno model fuzzy inference system is used for assessing the cluster head (CH) that takes residual energy, local distance, node degree, concentration, and distance from the base station as input parameters. Our enhanced routing protocol shows that the proper channel model with an efficient routing protocol enhances the link throughput of the VANET for fixed network size.

Although unequal clustering is an effective technique for alleviating the “energy holes” problem in multihop communication, resource scheduling based on unequal clustering is scarcely conducted. In the present study, a new resource scheduling based on unequal clustering in the Internet of Things (RSUC) is proposed. In RSUC, unequal clustering and multihop routing are considered, and the “energy holes” problem is alleviated effectively. RSUC includes resource scheduling of intracluster communication and intercluster communication. In resource scheduling of intracluster communication, according to the threshold of the number of cluster members, the cluster heads (CHs) recycle resources of failed nodes. In resource scheduling of intercluster communication, CHs in the different layers based on transmission chain obtain different sending and receiving time slots. In RSUC, CHs that are near the base station (BS) have fewer intracluster communication time slots and more intercluster communication time slots. Clusters that are further away from the BS end intercluster communication earlier and enter into intracluster communication instead of waiting for all CHs to complete intercluster communication.

This protocol operates at the network layer and can create routing and optimally distribute routing information between nodes. RPL is a low-power, high-throughput IPv6 routing protocol that uses distance vectors. Each sensor-to-wire network router has a collection of fixed parents and a preferred parent on the path to the Destination-oriented directed acyclic graph (DODAG) graph’s root in steady-state. Each router part of the graph sends DODAG information object (DIO) control messages and specifies its rank within the graph, indicating its position within the network relative to the root. When a node receives a DIO message, it determines its network rank, which must be higher than all its parents’ rank, and then continues sending DIO messages using the trickle timer. As a result, DODAG begins at the root and eventually extends to encompass the whole network.

A novel congestion control approach for optimal routing in Wireless Adhoc Networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dac.5151,none,RESEARCH ARTICLE,Wiley,2022,"Congestion is a demanding issue in WANET owing to dynamic routing and resource constraints. Congestion controlling (CC) is a huge concern in attaining equality among e2e flow control and optimal utilization of network resources. In WANET, with distributed resources, if numerous senders compete for a similar bandwidth link, the data rates should be adjusted to avoid network overload that leads to compromises in QoS. This paper introduces a new routing approach with CC model that deployed MAODV for WANETs. Initially, the destination and source nodes are initialized, and subsequently, the MAODV find out the various routing path. Consequently, SGD-DLNN recognizes all nodes' congestion status in revealed paths. Further, the MAODV assigns traffic in optimal congestion-less paths if congestion occurs. Here, the black widow-mutated cat swarm (BWM-CS) model is deployed to choose the optimal paths based on traffic load density, life span of path, traffic load, remaining energy, link cost, and path distance. Eventually, the advantage of the suggested model is proven.",none,

People are more interested in data than data location. An information-centric network (ICN) uses this idea and makes data, instead of host addresses, an integral component. Another essential topic in the contemporary period is cloud or edge computing, as well as the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), which becomes even more critical when combined with ICN.

Cooperative and Adaptive Network Coding for Gradient Based Routing in Wireless Sensor Networks with Multiple Sinks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2017/5301462,6,Research Article,Wiley,2017,"Despite its low computational cost, the Gradient Based Routing (GBR) broadcast of interest messages in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) causes significant packets duplications and unnecessary packets transmissions. This results in energy wastage, traffic load imbalance, high network traffic, and low throughput. Thanks to the emergence of fast and powerful processors, the development of efficient network coding strategies is expected to enable efficient packets aggregations and reduce packets retransmissions. For multiple sinks WSNs, the challenge consists of efficiently selecting a suitable network coding scheme. This article proposes a Cooperative and Adaptive Network Coding for GBR (CoAdNC-GBR) technique which considers the network density as dynamically defined by the average number of neighbouring nodes, to efficiently aggregate interest messages. The aggregation is performed by means of linear combinations of random coefficients of a finite Galois Field of variable size GF(2S) at each node and the decoding is performed by means of Gaussian elimination. The obtained results reveal that, by exploiting the cooperation of the multiple sinks, the CoAdNC-GBR not only improves the transmission reliability of links and lowers the number of transmissions and the propagation latency, but also enhances the energy efficiency of the network when compared to the GBR-network coding (GBR-NC) techniques.",none,

WBAN allows monitoring of patients continuously in their own comfort zone. These devices use the industrial, scientific, and medical band (ISM) for communication. This band is overcrowded due to the increasing number of wireless medical devices and other wireless devices occupying this band. This causes interference, which can be damaging and could result in a change in received power. However, WBAN also needs minimum and reliable energy communication for a longer lifetime and improved quality of service. This work addresses both problems and proposes solutions for the same.

A Data Forwarding Approach for Fire-Rescue Scenario with Multi-Type Mobile Nodes,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2019/3906483,none,Research Article,Wiley,2019,"The opportunistic mobile sensor network has been extensively applied in various public safety applications such as the fire rescue and earthquake rescue, since it can provide a surveillance range with an inexpensive cost and avoid the dangers of humans staying in risk zones. However, due to some environmental events such as building structure damage, airflow push, and fire explosions, the sensor nodes sprinkled into the fire-rescue scenario may be kept moving. Thus, the contacts between nodes become momentary, and the data packets cannot be forwarded along stable communication paths. To this end, the opportunistic forwarding manner is adopted in the fire-rescue scenario to enable the data packets to be transferred to the rescue control center (RCC) through some discrete hops. The contributions of this paper are threefold. First, the nodes in the fire-rescue scenario are carefully investigated and classified into four types: small-range mobile nodes (SRNs), large-range mobile nodes (LRNs), firefighter nodes (FNs), and robot nodes (RNs). Second, we formulate the data forwarding problem, and the optimal proportions of SRNs, LRNs, and FNs in data holders are mathematically analyzed to obtain the maximum delivery ratio. Third, a data forwarding approach for fire-rescue scenario (DFAFR) is proposed. In DFAFR, the optimal proportions of SRNs, LRNs, and FNs in data holders are maintained as far as possible through selecting different types of data holder candidates, and then the new data holders are determined from these data holder candidates and the adjacent RNs on basis of their expected delivery delay. Finally, the performance of DFAFR is analyzed through simulations of the fire-rescue scenario, and the results indicate that DFAFR can enhance the delivery ratio and shorten the delivery delay while the forwarding overhead is restricted.",none,

Energy efficient and QoS aware medium access control for wireless sensor networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpe.1579,58,Research Article,Wiley,2010,"Enabling quality of service (QoS) applications over battery-constrained wireless sensor networks (WSNs) poses significant challenges, because of the special characteristics of such networks. Developing real-time applications for WSNs necessitates the development of new communication protocols capable of achieving application-specific QoS and at the same time save energy. In this paper, we continue our previous work on developing and improving our EQ-MAC protocol, which is designed specifically for WSNs to reduce energy consumption and provides QoS guarantees through the use of the service differentiation concept. The proposed protocol consists of two subprotocols: Classifier MAC (C-MAC) and Channel Access MAC (CA-MAC). C-MAC is responsible of classifying gathered data at sensor nodes based on its importance. The CA-MAC is an energy conserving medium access mechanism which uses a hybrid scheduling technique. CA-MAC saves energy by differentiating between control and data messages. Data messages are assigned scheduled slots with no contention (here we have to emphasize that slots are assigned only to those nodes that have data to send, this allows an efficient energy use of the Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) slots), whereas short periodic control messages are assigned random access slots. To study the performance of the EQ-MAC protocol, we have conducted several simulation experiments on Network Simulator (NS-2) to evaluate and compare the performance of our protocol against S-MAC and Q-MAC protocols. Simulation results demonstrate that EQ-MAC outperforms the other two protocols and achieves a significant improvement in terms of the energy expenditure and delivery ratio. Under prioritized traffic, EQ-MAC is comparable to Q-MAC in average latency, while achieving less energy consumption. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",none,

Performance modeling and optimization of multiple-objective cross-layer design in multi-flow ad-hoc networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dac.3861,4,RESEARCH ARTICLE,Wiley,2018,"In ad-hoc wireless networks, to achieve good performance, multiple parameters need to be optimized jointly. However, existing literature lacks a design framework that investigates the synchronic impact of several parameters on overall system performance. Among several design parameters, energy conservation, end-to-end delay minimization, and improved throughput are considered most important for efficient operation of these networks. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for multiple-objective cross-layer optimization capable of optimizing all these performance objectives simultaneously for reliable, energy-efficient, and timely transmission of continuous media information across the network. The three global criteria considered for optimization are incorporated in a single programming problem via linear scalarization. Besides, we employ standard convex optimization method and Lagrangian technique to solve the proposed problem to seek optimality. Extensive simulation results are generated accounting for several topologies with multiple concurrent flows in the network. These results are used to validate the analytical results and demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed optimization model. Efficiency of the model is verified by finding the set of Pareto-optimal solutions plotted in three-dimensional objective space. These solution points constituting the Pareto front are used as the best possible balance points among maximum throughput, maximum residual energy, and least network delay. Finally, to emphasize the effectiveness and supremacy of our proposed multiple-objective cross-layer design scheme, we compare it with the conventional multiple-objective genetic algorithm.

Self-Administered Information Sharing Framework Using Bioinspired Mechanisms,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2020/8880730,1,Research Article,Wiley,2020,"The promising potential of distributed and interconnected lightweight devices that can jointly generate superior information-collecting and problem-solving abilities has long fostered various significant and ubiquitous techniques, from wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to Internet of Things (IoT). Although related applications have been widely used in different domains in attempting to collect and harness the ever-growing information flows, one major issue that impedes the further advancement of WSNs or IoT-based applications is the restricted battery power. Previous research mainly focuses on investigating novel protocols to save energy by reducing data traffic with the aid of optimal or heuristic algorithms.

How not to secure wireless sensor networks: a plethora of insecure polynomial-based key pre-distribution schemes,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1049/ise2.12016,none,ORIGINAL RESEARCH PAPER,Wiley,2021,"Three closely related polynomial-based group key pre-distribution schemes have recently been proposed, aimed specifically at wireless sensor networks. The schemes enable any subset of a predefined set of sensor nodes to establish a shared secret key without any communications overhead. It is claimed that these schemes are both secure and lightweight, that is, making them particularly appropriate for network scenarios where nodes have limited computational and storage capabilities. Further studies have built on these schemes, for example, to propose secure routing protocols for wireless sensor networks. Unfortunately, as shown by the author, all three schemes are completely insecure; whilst the details of their operation vary, they share common weaknesses. In two cases, we show that an attacker equipped with the information built into just one sensor node can compute all possible group keys, including those for which the attacked node is not a member; this breaks a fundamental design objective. In the other case, an attacker equipped with the information built into at most two sensor nodes can compute all possible group keys. In the latter case, the attack can also be achieved by an attacker armed with the information from a single node together with a single group key to which this sensor node is not entitled. Repairing the schemes appears difficult, if not impossible. The existence of major flaws is not surprising given the complete absence of any rigorous proofs of security for the proposed schemes. A further recent work proposes a group membership authentication and key establishment scheme based on one of the three key pre-distribution schemes analysed here; as the author demonstrates, this scheme is also insecure, as the attack we describe on the corresponding pre-distribution scheme enables the authentication process to be compromised.",none,
A novel approach for void avoidance in wireless sensor networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dac.1079,9,Research Article,Wiley,2010,"We propose a novel approach to treat the problem of void avoidance in sensor networks. In our approach, the choice of the forwarding region around a discovered void is oriented by the locations of (i) the sender node, (ii) the void center and (iii) the destination node. Three void-avoidance schemes are described which use the same void-discovery algorithm. Based on an oriented face routing, the first scheme is used by the boundary nodes to prevent packets from dropping. The second scheme is used by sender nodes located n-hops away from the void boundary to launch a preventive rerouting. The third scheme tends to protect packets from both the concave zones and the boundaries nodes of voids. Proposed schemes are simple to implement. They save network resources and could be easily associated with existing geographic routing protocols. Simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed approach.

QoS-Oriented Optimal Relay Selection in Cognitive Radio Networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2021/5580963,4,Research Article,Wiley,2021,"A cognitive radio network can be employed in any wireless communication systems, including military communications, public safety, emergency networks, aeronautical communications, and wireless-based Internet of Things, to enhance spectral efficiency. The performance of a cognitive radio network (CRN) can be enhanced through the use of cooperative relays with buffers; however, this incurs additional delays which can be reduced by using virtual duplex relaying that requires selection of a suitable relay pair. In a virtual duplex mode, we mimic full-duplex links by using simultaneous two half-duplex links, one transmitting and the other one receiving, in such a way that the overall effect of duplex mode is achieved. The relays are generally selected based on signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). However, other factors such as power consumption and buffer capacity can also have a significant impact on relay selection. In this work, a multiobjective relay selection scheme is proposed that simultaneously takes into account throughput, delay performance, battery power, and buffer status (i.e., both occupied and available) at the relay nodes while maintaining the required SINR. The proposed scheme involves the formulation of four objective functions to, respectively, maximize throughput and buffer space availability while minimizing the delay and battery power consumption. The weighted sum approach is then used to combine these objective functions to form the multiobjective optimization problem and an optimal solution is obtained. The assignments of weights to objectives have been done using the rank sum (RS) method, and several quality-of-service (QoS) profiles have been considered by varying the assignment of weights. The results gathered through simulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme efficiently determines the optimal solution for each application scenario and selects the best relay for the respective QoS profile. The results are further verified by using the genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) techniques. Both techniques gave identical solutions, thus validating our claim.",none,

Although one of the most appropriate schemes for handling energy constraints issues is the appropriate energy harvesting technique, the optimal energy optimization strategies should be coupled together for effectively utilizing the harvested energy. In this high-level systematic and taxonomical survey, we have organized the energy optimization strategies for EH-WSNs into eleven factors, namely, radio optimization schemes, optimizing the energy harvesting process, data reduction schemes, schemes based on cross-layer optimization, schemes based on cross-layer optimization, sleep/wake-up policies, schemes based on load balancing, schemes based on optimization of power requirement, optimization of communication mechanism, schemes based on optimization of battery operations, mobility-based schemes, and finally energy balancing schemes. We have also prepared the summarized view of various protocols/algorithms with their remarkable details. This systematic and taxonomy survey also provides a progressive detailed overview and classification of various optimization challenges for the EH-WSNs that require attention from the researcher followed by a survey of corresponding solutions for corresponding optimization issues. Further, this systematic and taxonomical survey also provides a deep analysis of various emerging energy harvesting technologies in the last twenty years of the era.",none,
An intelligent edge enabled 6G-flying ad-hoc network ecosystem for precision agriculture,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/exsy.13090,1,ORIGINAL ARTICLE,Wiley,2022,"Unmanned aerial vehicle based precision agriculture is a predominant research area. The modern flying ad-hoc network leverages the advanced low latency vehicular communication and intelligent computing paradigms that help the ecosystem to grow up to the next level. In this work, we propose an ecosystem for precision agriculture that leverages the use of the opportunistic MQTT protocol in an edge-enabled intelligent drone network for sensing and performing crop prediction using an intelligent ensemble machine learning model. The proposed approach leverages the edge computing system that requires low energy devices and also exploits the ultra-low latency opportunistic message transfer methodology. The experimental results show the maximum of 0.9 message delivery ratio and a minimum of 600 ms latency is achieved by opportunistic MQTT protocol in an ultra-low latency sparse network scenario. A weighted ensemble model is deployed onto the edge enabled devices or the drones.

Data transmission reduction techniques for improving network lifetime in wireless sensor networks: An up-to-date survey from 2017 to 2022,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ett.4674,1,SURVEY ARTICLE,Wiley,2022,"Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have now become a substantial part of our life as it provides an incredible setup for monitoring environmental conditions such as glaciers melting, earthquakes, climate change, volcanic eruption, agriculture, and other natural calamities. One of the most important challenges in data gathering and examining accurate data is “energy consumption.” However, continuously changing environmental conditions, mobility in devices and extreme resource usage, such as battery capacity in WSNs collectively contribute to a high possibility of redundant data transmission thus making it tremendously hard to achieve a satisfactory network lifetime. Additionally, these environmental monitoring applications periodically senses and aggregate data which usually exhibits high temporal and spatial redundancies. As a result, exploiting these redundancies is essential for both resource utilization, as well as accurate data transmission. Since a huge amount of energy is exhausted in transmitting the redundant data, which has become a bottleneck in scaling such applications. In this context, this article provides a thorough examination of existing energy-efficient redundant data transmission reduction techniques, as well as their strengths and drawbacks. The idea of redundant data transmission reduction concept is divided into three stages: the sensor nodes (SN) at the first stage, the cluster heads (CHs) at the second stage, and the base station (BS) at the third stage. Furthermore, this survey focuses on the current issues and challenges, as well as the future directions in reducing redundant data transmission for future investigation.",none,

A novel approach for drones positioning in mission critical applications,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ett.3603,42,SPECIAL ISSUE ARTICLE,Wiley,2019,"Recently, the flying sensor systems have been given a careful interest to provide critical administrations and services in a fiasco territory. Since severe debacles require the trading of geo-referenced area-based data among the salvage group and additionally the people in question, an independent exact situating framework is required. A Worldwide situating framework, or a global positioning system (GPS), gives close precise area data when there is an immediate viewable pathway with something like four satellites. Nonetheless, GPS beneficiaries may experience blackouts inside regions where satellite signs are hindered by impediments, for example, the normal mists in the sky and jammed structures in urban areas. This would prompt significant corruption in crisply developing remote detecting/flying applications, for example, those utilizing Drones.

An approach for provisioning virtual sensors in sensor clouds,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/nem.2062,6,RESEARCH ARTICLE,Wiley,2019,"In sensor clouds environments, the provisioning process is a crucial task since it is responsible for selecting physical sensors that will be used to create virtual sensors. However, most works consider the allocation of all sensors within the region of interest, causing serious problems such as the wasting of energy consumption. The objective of this paper is to present ACxSIM, an automatic approach to the provisioning of virtual sensors. ACxSIM includes two algorithms: adaptive clustering algorithm based on similarity (ACASIM) and ant colony optimization for sensor selection based on similarity (ACOSIM). ACASIM first clusters the sensor nodes based on the similarity of its measurements (exploiting the temporal and spatial correlations between them), which may create clusters with nodes not physically close to each other. Therefore, in ACASIM, a cluster represents different geographical areas whose nodes have correlated measurements (according to a defined error threshold). Later, ACOSIM, based on ant colony optimization algorithm, creates virtual sensors by selecting only a subset of nodes from each cluster. In this way, the overall energy consumption of sensor nodes is reduced, prolonging the lifetime of the sensor cloud. Results from experiments in Intel Lab dataset show that the ACxSIM reduces energy consumption by 73.97%, providing a solution to be considered in sensor cloud scenarios.",none,
Signaling game approach to improve the MAC protocol in the underwater wireless sensor networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dac.3971,8,RESEARCH ARTICLE,Wiley,2019,"Underwater sensor networks (UWSNs) are instructed for critical applications like military surveillance and underwater oil spills that conducted in a very massive three-dimensional (3-D) space that needs many underwater nodes (UNs) to cover the target area. Those UNs are not easy to recharge and cannot exploit solar power. MAC protocols deployed for UWSN ought to consider the energy efficiency, so as, to extend the network lifetime with total connectivity and significant throughput. Terrestrial MAC protocols could not be used for UWSN due to long and unpredictable propagation delay. Consequently, the development of a new MAC protocol for the harsh environment as underwater is a challenging task. In this study, we focus on the deployment of TDMA in UWSN for this, two schemes entitled TDMA slot sharing (TSS) and free time slots reallocation (FTSR) are proposed. Received data stored in the buffer waiting for processing and forwarding might lead to an unlimited data transfer latency those results in the buffer overflow. Otherwise, free time slots appearing during the communication process resulting from dead nodes increase uselessly sleep time for the rest of the nodes. Both schemes based on signaling game are proposed to overcome those problems, TSS is used to enable the slot sharing between UNs during the communication process to reduce the buffer overflow. FTSR scheme aims to increase the throughput of UNs by allowing the reuse of free time slots. Numerical results conducted in this work show good improvement in the network performance concerning throughput.",none,

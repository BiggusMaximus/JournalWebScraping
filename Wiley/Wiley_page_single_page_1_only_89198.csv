Novel Learning Algorithms for Efficient Mobile Sink Data Collection Using Reinforcement Learning in Wireless Sensor Network,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2018/7560167,18,Research Article,Wiley,2018,"Generally, wireless sensor network is a group of sensor nodes which is used to continuously monitor and record the various physical, environmental, and critical real time application data. Data traffic received by sink in WSN decreases the energy of nearby sensor nodes as compared to other sensor nodes. This problem is known as hot spot problem in wireless sensor network. In this research study, two novel algorithms are proposed based upon reinforcement learning to solve hot spot problem in wireless sensor network. The first proposed algorithm RLBCA, created cluster heads to reduce the energy consumption and save about 40% of battery power. In the second proposed algorithm ODMST, mobile sink is used to collect the data from cluster heads as per the demand/request generated from cluster heads. Here mobile sink is used to keep record of incoming request from cluster heads in a routing table and visits accordingly. These algorithms did not create the extra overhead on mobile sink and save the energy as well.

Enhanced reinforcement learning assisted dynamic power management model for internet-of-things centric wireless sensor network,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1049/iet-com.2020.0026,15,Research Article,Wiley,2021,"The exponential rise in the demands of the wireless communication system has alarmed industries to achieve more efficient and quality-of-service (QoS) centric wireless communication networks. The decentralised and infrastructure-less nature of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) enable it to be one of the most sought and used wireless network globally. Its cost-efficiency and functional robustness towards low-power lossy networks make it suitable for internet-of-things (IoT) applications. In recent years, IoT technologies have been used in diverse applications, including Smart City Planning and Management (SCPM). Although, mobile-WSN has played a decisive role in IoT enabled SCPM, its routing optimality and power transmission have always remained challenging. Noticeably, major existing researches address mainly on routing optimisation and very few efforts are made towards dynamic power management (DPM) under non-linear network conditions. With this motive, in this study, a highly robust and efficient QoS – centric reinforcement learning-based DPM model has been developed for mobile-WSN to be used in SCPM. Unlike classical reinforcement learning methods, the authors’ proposed advanced reinforcement learning-based DPM model exploits both known and unknown network parameters and state-activity values, including bit-error probability, channel state information, holding time, buffer cost etc. to perform dynamic switching decision. The key objective of the proposed model is to ensure optimal QoS oriented DPM and adaptive switching control to yield reliable transmission with the maximum possible resource utilisation. To achieve it, they proposed model has been developed as a controlled-Markov decision problem by applying hidden Markov model it obtains known and unknown parameters, which are subsequently learnt using an enhanced reinforcement learning to yield maximum resource utilisation while maintaining low buffer cost, holding cost and bit-error probability to retain the QoS provision.",none
Fault-tolerant independent gradient forwarding routing for wireless sensor network,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dac.5899,none,RESEARCH ARTICLE,Wiley,2024,"For the sensor network, greedy forwarding is thought to be the best energy-efficient routing method. There are two restrictions on greedy forwarding: a minimum local scenario and an intersection problem in which it is unable to locate an existing route. The proposed independent gradient forward (IGF) proves that the Euclidean equation used by greedy forwarding is less capable of dealing with the problems mentioned above. IGF considers each dimension independently to enhance the efficiency of greedy forwarding, sustaining its simplicity. It contributes to strengthening the suggested IGF's ability to manage holes and get around obstructions in the wireless sensor network. We have demonstrated that it travels a shorter potential path and avoids stuck nodes well in advance. It is more energy-efficient since it can predict the void node and never visits a stalled node. We evaluated the suggested IGF's performance against other traditional boundary traversal-based methods on both rare and dense networks. In comparison with other boundary traversal-based algorithms, the simulation results indicate that it generates a 10% smaller route to bypass. The IGF average energy consumption increases slowly, rising by just 7% and 12.5% for dense and rare networks, respectively, with a fivefold increase in void size (from 100 to 500 m).",none
An Energy-Balanced Routing Protocol for a Wireless Sensor Network,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2018/8505616,31,Research Article,Wiley,2018,"The wireless sensor network is an intelligent self-organizing network which consists of many sensor nodes deployed in the monitoring area. The greatest challenge of designing a wireless sensor network is to balance the energy consumption and prolong the lifetime of the network, seeing that the nodes can be powered only by batteries in most conditions. An energy-balanced routing protocol (EBRP) for wireless sensor networks is proposed in this paper.

Since the previous researches did not demonstrate how to get the fuzzy rules for different networks, we propose a genetic algorithm (GA) to obtain the fuzzy rules. We code the rules as a chromosome, and the lifetime of the network is treated as a fit function. Then, through the selection, crossover, and mutation of each generation, the best offspring can be decoded as the best rule for each network model. Through the simulation, comparing with the existing routing protocols such as low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LEACH), low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy-centralized (LEACH-C), and stable election protocol (SEP), the EBRP prolongs the network lifetime (first node dies) by 57%, 63%, and 63%, respectively.",none
Energy efficient and effective node deployment for wireless sensor network,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dac.5139,none,RESEARCH ARTICLE,Wiley,2022,"The development of tiny sensor nodes (SNs) has incarnated numerous applications in the field of wireless sensor networks (WSN).

Detection of unique delete attack in wireless sensor network using gradient thresholding-long short-term memory algorithm,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpe.7332,none,RESEARCH ARTICLE,Wiley,2022,"Wireless sensor network (WSN) is widely used in many fields, including agriculture, military, healthcare, monitoring, and surveillance. WSN application increases day by day due to growth in embedded and internet technologies. However, data security in WSN is challenging, and different types of attacks are increasing. Traditional intrusion detection methods analyze and identify attacks such as Denial of Service, anomaly detection, wormhole, sybil, and blackhole. Traditional methods never addressed the application layer's novel attack, such as the delete attack. Unique DELETE attack (DA) forms in the application layer and targets web servers and applications. Since unique DA use uniform resource locator requests, distinguishing them from legitimate traffic becomes difficult. The unique DA classify as unique (or) single, multiple, and repeated unique DELETE attacks; for detecting the unique DA types, gradient thresholding-long short-term memory (GT-LSTM) algorithm is proposed using packet per second and traffic rate data in WSN nodes. GT-LSTM algorithm detects unique DA through different thresholding at the training option layer in LSTM. Different gradient thresholding values in LSTM reduce the exploding gradients which fail to detect the unique DA nodes. Gradient thresholding in LSTM layers lies 1 to 3 for detecting unique DELETE attack nodes. The proposed method reduces detection time, improves accuracy, and identifies the hidden node that performs a unique DA in WSN. The unique DELETE Attack identification and performance through the proposed GT-LSTM is analyzed in the NS2 simulation environment and the test bed of WSN. Forms the experimental and simulation results, GT-LSTM performs better than fuzzy, KNN, and linear regression-based intruder detection systems.

One of the essential approaches to improve WSN performance is clustering, routing, and denoising technique. Cluster head (CH) selection is an essential issue in WSN. The present work proposes cross-layer-based opportunistic routing protocol (CORP) for WSN. The proposed CORP approach has been used to find an optimal traversal path, which reduces computation time and energy consumption as well as improves data delivery reliability. For optimal clustering, K-medoid with adaptive Harris hawk optimization algorithm (AHHO) has been utilized for clustering the sensor nodes. Quality of service (QoS) impact, energy status criteria, distance, and sensor nodes position have been considered as key factors. These factors can influence the selection of CH in WSN. Moreover, the CH selection method can minimize traffic and energy saving.

Initially, in the data collection phase, the variable weighted stacked autoencoder senses the data and collects all the data from the network. Adaptive sunflower optimization algorithm (ASFO) updates the weight of VWAE to minimize the data error and model complexity. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed CORP approach enhances QoS performance metrics such as energy consumption, packet delivery ratio, packet delay, network lifetime, throughput, jitter, buffer occupancy, and packet loss ratio.

The CAM is based on developing a backoff mechanism which mainly differentiates nodes’ backoffs depending on their different identification numbers, and it employs a performance tuning parameter for reaching a required performance objective. The probability distribution of the backoff period is constructed and Markov chain modeling is used to analyze and evaluate the CAM against the IEEE802.15.4 slotted CSMA/CA based on single- and multihop communication with respect to the reliability, the average delay, the power consumption, and the throughput. The analysis reveals that the required performance of CAM against the IEEE slotted CSMA/CA can be obtained by choosing the maximum backoff stages number and the tuning parameter value and that CAM performs better than the IEEE with larger nodes number. The multihop scenario results in a good end-to-end performance of CAM with respect to the reliability and delay becomes better with lengthier paths at the expense of increasing the energy consumption.",none

Therefore, the usage of such resources needs to be carefully managed, and the sharing with several applications imposes new challenges in achieving energy efficiency in these networks. In order to exploit the full potential of multi-functional WSN systems, it is crucial to design mechanisms that effectively allocate tasks onto sensors so that the entire system lifetime is maximized while meeting various application requirements.

Dynamic scheming the duty cycle in the opportunistic routing sensor network,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpe.4196,7,SPECIAL ISSUE PAPER,Wiley,2017,"In wireless sensor networks, a lot of applications need the sensed information be transmitted to the sink node within a predefined time threshold. So end-to-end delay is an important performance metric in wireless sensor networks. Opportunistic routing protocols have been proposed to reduce the waiting delay. In the duty cycle networks, increasing the duty cycle ratio can also reduce the end-to-end delay. However, this method will consume more energy. It is obvious that there exists a trade-off between delay and energy consumption. So adjusting the duty cycle ratio of each node can investigate this trade-off. To the best of our knowledge, no existing work takes both of end-to-end delay and energy efficiency into consideration in the opportunistic routing networks. In this paper, we want to minimize the whole energy consumption while guaranteeing the expected end-to-end delay between the source nodes and the sink node is below the given threshold. To deal with this problem, we propose a dynamic duty cycle scheme which can significantly reduce the energy consumption and guarantee the expected end-to-end delay demand in the opportunistic routing network. To be specific, firstly, we formulate a new metric with the wake-up time slots as the variable to measure the end-to-end delay. Secondly, for simplifying the complex problem, we decompose it into a set of single-hop delay guarantee problems. Feedback controller has been used to solve the problem.

Moreover, integrating SDN with IoT-enabled sensor network puts forward several challenges, for example, control nodes' selection, load balancing, and energy cost optimization while aggregating the collected data, focusing on heterogeneous traffic data. Thus, an energy-efficient data collection technique via definite sensing control in two-level IoT-enabled software-defined heterogeneous WSN (2SD-HWSN) is formulated as an optimization problem, with transmission distance from smart sensors, residual energy of sensors, and load based on node density. The proposed algorithm is divided into two: set-up and transmission phases. In the set-up phase, the control server (CS) elects the best-suited control nodes (CNs) and sets up a schedule for coordinating data transmission. Further, normal nodes join appropriate CNs based on distance and residual energy. This way, CNs form clusters and route sensed data during the transmission phase.

CPEH: A Clustering Protocol for the Energy Harvesting Wireless Sensor Networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2021/5533374,4,Research Article,Wiley,2021,"In the last decade, energy harvesting wireless sensor network (EHWSN) has been well developed. By harvesting energy from the surrounding environment, sensors in EHWSN remove the energy constraint and have an unlimited lifetime in theory. The long-lasting character makes EHWSN suitable for Industry 4.0 applications that usually need sensors to monitor the machine state and detect errors continuously. Most wireless sensor network protocols have become inefficient in EHWSN due to neglecting the energy harvesting property. In this paper, we propose CPEH, which is a clustering protocol specially designed for the EHWSN. CPEH considers the diversity of the energy harvesting ability among sensors in both cluster formation and intercluster communication. It takes the node’s information such as local energy state, local density, and remote degree into account and uses fuzzy logic to conduct the cluster head selection and cluster size allocation. Meanwhile, the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) as a reinforcement learning strategy is utilized by CPEH to discover a highly efficient intercluster routing between cluster heads and the base station. Furthermore, to avoid cluster dormancy, CPEH introduces the Cluster Head Relay (CHR) strategy to allow the proper cluster member to undertake the cluster head that is energy depletion. We make a detailed simulation of CPEH with some famous clustering protocols under different network scenarios. The result shows that CPEH can effectively improve the network throughput and delivery ratio than others as well as successfully solve the cluster dormancy problem.",none

Routing attacks are attacks that have the ability to interfere with the operation of WSN. A reliable routing system is needed for guaranteeing routing security including WSN effectiveness.

WSN applications are constrained by the limited set of computing resources possessed by the sensor nodes and the security aspects of data communication in the WSN. Many algorithms based on nature-inspired optimization (NIO) have been proposed in the past to optimize the issue of energy efficiency and security in WSN. In the proposed work, two opportunistic routing algorithms, i.e., intelligent opportunistic routing protocol (IOP) and trust-based secure intelligent opportunistic routing protocol (TBSIOP), are compared against two NIO algorithms developed for achieving energy efficiency and security in WSN for performance analysis. The performance is evaluated by simulating the algorithms on MATLAB and comparing the obtained results with existing ACO-based and PSO-based routing algorithms. It is observed that the TBSIOP outperforms the NIO-based algorithms in terms of energy efficiency, network lifetime, packet delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, and average risk level. All the parameters under consideration are recorded in the presence of a maximum of 50% malicious nodes for 25, 50, and 100 nodes’ test cases. The increasing size of the network has a significant effect on the performance of TBSIOP, as the packet delivery ratio is close to 100%. Also, TBSIOP can easily avoid malicious nodes during the routing process as reflected from the results. This will improve the network lifetime of TBSIOP compared to other protocols.

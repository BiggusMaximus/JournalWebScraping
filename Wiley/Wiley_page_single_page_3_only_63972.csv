Energy efficient grid based k-means clustering algorithm for large scale wireless sensor networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dac.5255,3,RESEARCH ARTICLE,Wiley,2022,"Hierarchical based routing is a kind of group-based routing that consists in creating of a virtual hierarchy among network sensor nodes. This class of routing technique is generally designed for large-scale networks. It aims to efficiently increase network lifetime by cutting the whole network into clusters. However, traditional clustering techniques show some limitations and do not take into consideration the self-organized with dynamic topology inherent in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). These limitations can lead to an unbalanced cluster head distribution that affects the whole network energy consumption. In this paper, we propose a grid-based k-means clustering protocol (named GBK), which combines grid-based routing with k-means algorithm in order to overcome the above mentioned weaknesses. From the supervised zone area size parameter, the base station determines the optimal grid size based on our optimization study. Afterwards, the k-means algorithm is executed in every grid cell generating a cluster head per cell grid where the nearest node to the grid cell centroid is elected. An enhancement of this proposed GBK algorithm named GBK-R is also proposed to extend network stability of the GBK algorithm by node scoring calculation that take as parameters the node remaining energy in addition to the distance to centroid. Our proposed GBK and GBK-R algorithms allow for an enhanced network stability and increase the network lifetime as demonstrated by our performance evaluation study. In addition, this GBK clustering algorithm provides a better network topology control and a better control of the random nature of node distribution by generating cluster heads with bounded localization.",none
The applications of the routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks (RPL) on the internet of mobile things,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dac.5253,3,RESEARCH ARTICLE,Wiley,2022,"Internet of Mobile Things (IoMT) have become very popular recently. The routing protocol for low power and lossy networks (RPL) is standardized for static topologies. However, mobility is the nature of IoT. Mobility serves as a promising candidate to harness hand-off time issues, delay in data transmission, overhead, and low packet delivery rate (PDR) effectively. This study presents a comprehensive account of the mobility-aware RPL-based routing protocols to validate and compare the experimental results. Remarkably, classification methods are used in many articles. The aim is to introduce significant research efforts to improve RPL objective functions (OF) performance in hand-off time, PDR, delay, overhead, and so forth. In this regard, a complete analysis of the existing routing protocols in IoMT has been presented to compare the results. The main focus of this study is on approaches that proposed new OFs for supporting mobility in RPL. Two main categories are considered to study RPL-based routing protocol mechanisms: The mobile and static sink. The related studies on the mobile sink are divided into three groups: Single metric-based OF, composite metric OF, and hybrid routing protocols. Also, the related works based on the static sink are categorized into four groups: Fuzzy logic-based OF, trickle timer-based OF, composite metrics-based OF, and modification control messages-based OF approach. This paper presents a detailed comparison of mechanisms in each category. It also highlights the pros, cons, open issues, and evaluated metrics of each paper.

Heuristic Localization Algorithm with a Novel Error Control Mechanism for Wireless Sensor Networks with Few Anchor Nodes,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2018/5190543,3,Research Article,Wiley,2018,"A novel iterative localization algorithm with high accuracy and low anchor node dependency for large-scale wireless sensor networks is proposed in this paper. At each iteration, blind nodes are located using a weighted linear least squares-based algorithm. To prevent errors in the blind nodes from propagating and accumulating throughout the network, an anchor geometric feature-based error control mechanism is used to select the nodes that participate in the localization and to estimate the localization confidence. The simulation results show that the algorithm can be used when only a few anchor nodes are involved. This algorithm is more advanced than traditional methods, which often require a large number of well-placed anchor nodes to operate appropriately. By optimizing the decision parameter v of the algorithm, the average localization error of the algorithm is approximately 0.43 meters. When the ratio of anchor nodes (the ratio of the number of anchor nodes to the number of sensor nodes in the network) is 1.25% (i.e., 5 anchor nodes for 400 sensor nodes), the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) variance is 8 dBm, and the radio range is 50 meters. A comparison of the proposed algorithm with global localization methods, including multidimensional scaling (MDS), semidefinite programming (SDP), and shortest-path access (SPA), shows that the proposed algorithm achieves higher location accuracy and stability when the number of anchor nodes is varied. The efficiency of the proposed localization algorithm is evaluated in a real sensor network, and the accuracy is high and robust to radio channel variance.",none
Enhanced Route Discovery Mechanism Using Improved CH Selection Using Q-Learning to Minimize Delay,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2022/3187858,2,Research Article,Wiley,2022,"With the technological advancements, practical challenges of establishing long-distance communication should be addressed using hop-oriented routing networks. However, long-distance data transmissions usually deteriorate the quality of service (QoS) especially in terms of considerable communication delay. Therefore, in the presented work, a reward-based routing mechanism is proposed that aims at minimizing the overall delay which is evaluated under various scenarios. The routing process involved a refined CH selection mechanism based on a mathematical model until a threshold simulation is not attained. The illustrations for the coverage calculations of CH in the route discovery are also provided for possible routes between the source and the destination to deliver quality service. Based on this information, the data gathered from the past simulations is passed to the learning mechanism using the Q-learning model. The work is evaluated in terms of throughput, PDR, and first dead node in order to achieve minimal transmission delay. Furthermore, area variation is also involved to investigate the effect of an increase in the deployment area and number of nodes on a Q-learning-based mechanism aimed to minimize the delay. The comparative analysis against four existing studies justifies the success of the proposed mechanism in terms of throughput, first dead node, and delay analysis.",none

First, an equation of performance gradient in the event-based policy space is derived based on a fundamental quantity called Q-factors of EBO. With the performance gradient, we can find the local optimum of EBO using the gradient-based algorithm. Compared to the policy iteration approach in EBO, this policy gradient approach does not require restrictive conditions and it has a wider application scenario. The policy gradient approach is further implemented based on the online estimation of Q-factors. This approach does not require the prior information about the system parameters, such as the transition probability.

However, many of the existing WSN data collection researches are based on a relatively simple linear or plane network model. The three-dimensional space problems are simplified to two-dimensional plane, which limits the applicability. In this paper, the data collection in 3D WSN is studied. In the three-dimensional space, we firstly analyze the data loads, energy consumption, and end-to-end (E2E) delay of each node when the network is following the shortest path routing. The mathematical analysis of data loads and E2E delay of each node are presented. Based on the analysis of data loads and energy consumption, an energy-ware data transmission scheme is proposed to achieve the trade-off optimization between the E2E delay and network lifetime under the guarantee of the transmission reliability.

FAPRP: A Machine Learning Approach to Flooding Attacks Prevention Routing Protocol in Mobile Ad Hoc Networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2019/6869307,19,Research Article,Wiley,2019,"Request route flooding attack is one of the main challenges in the security of Mobile Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs) as it is easy to initiate and difficult to prevent. A malicious node can launch an attack simply by sending an excessively high number of route request (RREQ) packets or useless data packets to nonexistent destinations. As a result, the network is rendered useless as all its resources are used up to serve this storm of RREQ packets and hence unable to perform its normal routing duty. Most existing research efforts on detecting such a flooding attack use the number of RREQs originated by a node per unit time as the threshold to classify an attacker. These algorithms work to some extent; however, they suffer high misdetection rate and reduce network performance. This paper proposes a new flooding attacks detection algorithm (FADA) for MANETs based on a machine learning approach. The algorithm relies on the route discovery history information of each node to capture similar characteristics and behaviors of nodes belonging to the same class to decide if a node is malicious. The paper also proposes a new flooding attacks prevention routing protocol (FAPRP) by extending the original AODV protocol and integrating FADA algorithm. The performance of the proposed solution is evaluated in terms of successful attack detection ratio, packet delivery ratio, and routing load both in normal and under RREQ attack scenarios using NS2 simulation. The simulation results show that the proposed FAPRP can detect over 99% of RREQ flooding attacks for all scenarios using route discovery frequency vector of sizes larger than 35 and performs better in terms of packet delivery ratio and routing load compared to existing solutions for RREQ flooding attacks.",none

Enhanced clustering based routing protocol in vehicular ad-hoc networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1049/els2.12069,2,ORIGINAL RESEARCH,Wiley,2023,"A vehicular ad-hoc network (VANET) is derived from a mobile ad-hoc network that is a part of less infrastructure network design. Vehicular communication in VANET can be achieved using vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication. A vehicle communicates with other vehicles through onboard units while communicating with roadside units in an infrastructure mode. Secure clustering is required for the communication between nodes in the whole network. The fundamental problem with the VANET is the instability of the network that occurs due to vehicles' mobile nature, which decreases the network's efficiency. This research proposes an enhanced cluster-based lifetime protocol ECBLTR that focuses on maximising the network's stability of routing and average throughput. The Sugeno model fuzzy inference system is used for assessing the cluster head (CH) that takes residual energy, local distance, node degree, concentration, and distance from the base station as input parameters.

Resource Scheduling Based on Unequal Clustering in Internet of Things,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2022/1810704,none,Research Article,Wiley,2022,"Resource scheduling in a fair and efficient manner is a significant challenge in the Internet of Things. Although unequal clustering is an effective technique for alleviating the “energy holes” problem in multihop communication, resource scheduling based on unequal clustering is scarcely conducted. In the present study, a new resource scheduling based on unequal clustering in the Internet of Things (RSUC) is proposed. In RSUC, unequal clustering and multihop routing are considered, and the “energy holes” problem is alleviated effectively. RSUC includes resource scheduling of intracluster communication and intercluster communication. In resource scheduling of intracluster communication, according to the threshold of the number of cluster members, the cluster heads (CHs) recycle resources of failed nodes. In resource scheduling of intercluster communication, CHs in the different layers based on transmission chain obtain different sending and receiving time slots. In RSUC, CHs that are near the base station (BS) have fewer intracluster communication time slots and more intercluster communication time slots. Clusters that are further away from the BS end intercluster communication earlier and enter into intracluster communication instead of waiting for all CHs to complete intercluster communication.

Sensor Duty Cycle for Prolonging Network Lifetime Using Quantum Clone Grey Wolf Optimization Algorithm in Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2021/5511745,5,Research Article,Wiley,2021,"The application of industrial wireless sensor networks (IWSNs) frequently appears in modern industry, and it is usually to deploy a large quantity of sensor nodes in the monitoring area. This way of deployment improves the robustness of the IWSNs but introduces many redundant nodes, thereby increasing unnecessary overhead. The purpose of this paper is to increase the lifetime of IWSNs without changing the physical facilities and ensuring the coverage of sensors as much as possible. Therefore, we propose a quantum clone grey wolf optimization (QCGWO) algorithm, design a sensor duty cycle model (SDCM) based on real factory conditions, and use the QCGWO to optimize the SDCM. Specifically, QCGWO combines the concept of quantum computing and the clone operation for avoiding the algorithm from falling into a local optimum. Subsequently, we compare the proposed algorithm with the genetic algorithm (GA) and simulated annealing (SA) algorithm. The experimental results suggest that the lifetime of the IWSNs based on QCGWO is longer than that of GA and SA, and the convergence speed of QCGWO is also faster than that of GA and SA. In comparison with the traditional IWSN working mode, our model and algorithm can effectively prolong the lifetime of IWSNs, thus greatly reducing the maintenance cost without replacing sensor nodes in actual industrial production.",none

UAVs can operate as data ferry nodes, connecting distributed areas that are separated from each other. This paper proposes a data collection method for distributed wireless sensor networks based on UAV and introduces the idea of edge computing in it. In the single-hop transmission scenario, the K-means++ clustering method is used for sensor node clustering and cluster head election in the initial state. In the next rounds of data collection, UAV is used to assist in the election of new cluster heads and data collection tasks, taking into account the relative distance and the relative remaining energy relationship of the sensor nodes in their clusters. In addition, reasonable priorities are set for some nodes that have never been elected in the previous rounds and for the dead nodes. In the multihop transmission scenarios, for nodes that cannot deliver directly, the optimal relay node is selected for routing by comprehensively considering factors such as transmission angle, transmission distance, and remaining energy of the node in each cluster. The method proposed in this paper coordinates the overall energy consumption of sensor nodes in the environmental monitoring area, delays the death time of key sensor nodes, and extends the network lifetime.

A Review of Intrusion Detection Systems in RPL Routing Protocol Based on Machine Learning for Internet of Things Applications,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2021/8414503,23,Review Article,Wiley,2021,"IPv6 routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks (RPL) has been developed as a routing agent in low-power and lossy networks (LLN), where nodes’ resource constraint nature is challenging. This protocol operates at the network layer and can create routing and optimally distribute routing information between nodes. RPL is a low-power, high-throughput IPv6 routing protocol that uses distance vectors. Each sensor-to-wire network router has a collection of fixed parents and a preferred parent on the path to the Destination-oriented directed acyclic graph (DODAG) graph’s root in steady-state. Each router part of the graph sends DODAG information object (DIO) control messages and specifies its rank within the graph, indicating its position within the network relative to the root. When a node receives a DIO message, it determines its network rank, which must be higher than all its parents’ rank, and then continues sending DIO messages using the trickle timer. As a result, DODAG begins at the root and eventually extends to encompass the whole network. This paper is the first review to study intrusion detection systems in the RPL protocol based on machine learning (ML) techniques to the best of our knowledge. The complexity of the new attack models identified for RPL and the efficiency of ML in intelligent and collaborative threats detection, and the issues of deploying ML in challenging LLN environments underscore the importance of research in this area.

To address these issues, both clustering and routing algorithms are utilized. Therefore, this paper proposes an intelligent energy-efficient data routing scheme for WSNs utilizing a mobile sink (MS) to save energy and prolong network lifetime. The proposed scheme operates in two major modes: configure and operational modes. During the configure mode, a novel clustering mechanism is applied once, and a prescheduling cluster head (CH) selection is introduced to ensure uniform energy expenditure among sensor nodes (SNs). The scheduling technique selects successive CHs for each cluster throughout the WSNs’ lifetime rounds, managed at the base station (BS) to minimize SN energy consumption. In the operational mode, two main objectives are achieved: sensing and gathering data by each CH with minimal message overhead, and establishing an optimal path for the MS using the genetic algorithm. Finally, the MS uploads the gathered data to the BS. Extensive simulations are conducted to verify the efficiency of the proposed scheme in terms of stability period, network lifetime, average energy consumption, data transmission latency, message overhead, and throughput.

To this end, the opportunistic forwarding manner is adopted in the fire-rescue scenario to enable the data packets to be transferred to the rescue control center (RCC) through some discrete hops. The contributions of this paper are threefold. First, the nodes in the fire-rescue scenario are carefully investigated and classified into four types: small-range mobile nodes (SRNs), large-range mobile nodes (LRNs), firefighter nodes (FNs), and robot nodes (RNs). Second, we formulate the data forwarding problem, and the optimal proportions of SRNs, LRNs, and FNs in data holders are mathematically analyzed to obtain the maximum delivery ratio. Third, a data forwarding approach for fire-rescue scenario (DFAFR) is proposed.

Developing real-time applications for WSNs necessitates the development of new communication protocols capable of achieving application-specific QoS and at the same time save energy. In this paper, we continue our previous work on developing and improving our EQ-MAC protocol, which is designed specifically for WSNs to reduce energy consumption and provides QoS guarantees through the use of the service differentiation concept. The proposed protocol consists of two subprotocols: Classifier MAC (C-MAC) and Channel Access MAC (CA-MAC). C-MAC is responsible of classifying gathered data at sensor nodes based on its importance. The CA-MAC is an energy conserving medium access mechanism which uses a hybrid scheduling technique. CA-MAC saves energy by differentiating between control and data messages. Data messages are assigned scheduled slots with no contention (here we have to emphasize that slots are assigned only to those nodes that have data to send, this allows an efficient energy use of the Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) slots), whereas short periodic control messages are assigned random access slots.

NOSS (novel optimal sleep scheduling) scheme for energy and data reliability optimisation in mobile cloud-assisted wireless sensor networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1049/joe.2019.0786,2,Special Section: Evolution of Instrumentation and Electronics System Technologies in Smart Grid,Wiley,2019,"MCC is one of the best opportunities to provide reliable data transmission to the users in mobility through integration with wireless sensor networks (WSNs), and this integration of MCC–WSN enables the mobile user to receive all communication in the digitised form. Many researchers proposed the MCC–WSN integration scheme to concentrate on the delay and energy trade-off instead of a novel optimal sleep scheduling (NOSS) scheme proposed for energy and reliability optimisation and it has three-fold uses in implementation: (i) a selective optimal data forward method used to forward the gathered data in selective custom, which maximises the data reliability; (ii) an improved fish swarm optimisation algorithm is used to compute the awake or asleep status of each sensor node, which minimises the energy consumption; (iii) a partial priority-based decision-making algorithm is used to compute the best request received from the user among multiple requests. In addition, the NOSS scheme would gather and forward data in a more reliable, energy-efficient way without affecting the scalability with robustness in comparison with the existing schemes. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed NOSS scheme in enhancing the usefulness of energy consumption and data reliability of WSNs.",none

Performance modeling and optimization of multiple-objective cross-layer design in multi-flow ad-hoc networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dac.3861,4,RESEARCH ARTICLE,Wiley,2018,"In ad-hoc wireless networks, to achieve good performance, multiple parameters need to be optimized jointly. However, existing literature lacks a design framework that investigates the synchronic impact of several parameters on overall system performance. Among several design parameters, energy conservation, end-to-end delay minimization, and improved throughput are considered most important for efficient operation of these networks. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for multiple-objective cross-layer optimization capable of optimizing all these performance objectives simultaneously for reliable, energy-efficient, and timely transmission of continuous media information across the network. The three global criteria considered for optimization are incorporated in a single programming problem via linear scalarization. Besides, we employ standard convex optimization method and Lagrangian technique to solve the proposed problem to seek optimality. Extensive simulation results are generated accounting for several topologies with multiple concurrent flows in the network. These results are used to validate the analytical results and demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed optimization model. Efficiency of the model is verified by finding the set of Pareto-optimal solutions plotted in three-dimensional objective space. These solution points constituting the Pareto front are used as the best possible balance points among maximum throughput, maximum residual energy, and least network delay. Finally, to emphasize the effectiveness and supremacy of our proposed multiple-objective cross-layer design scheme, we compare it with the conventional multiple-objective genetic algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that our method provides significant performance gain over the genetic algorithm approach in terms of the above specified three objectives.",none

It attracts attention of researchers toward nanocommunication and trying to give comprehensive set of tools to the engineering community. Nanonetwork contains nanosized communication devices that can be used in the field of military, bio medical, environment, ICT, and industry. Its communication abilities make this field powerful enough to make the devices interact with each other in the micro/macro world.

Cloud-fog assisted human tracing and disaster evacuation framework,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ett.4892,none,RESEARCH ARTICLE,Wiley,2023,"Many kinds of natural hazards and man-made calamities have occurred in recent years, each of which has left a huge number of victims and has been challenging to deal with. The solution is an effective evacuation planning system, which is gaining the interest of governments, academic institutions, and industries all across the world. This study focuses on quick and organized evacuation from densely populated areas during disasters to decrease damage successfully.

Self-Administered Information Sharing Framework Using Bioinspired Mechanisms,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2020/8880730,1,Research Article,Wiley,2020,"The promising potential of distributed and interconnected lightweight devices that can jointly generate superior information-collecting and problem-solving abilities has long fostered various significant and ubiquitous techniques, from wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to Internet of Things (IoT). Although related applications have been widely used in different domains in attempting to collect and harness the ever-growing information flows, one major issue that impedes the further advancement of WSNs or IoT-based applications is the restricted battery power. Previous research mainly focuses on investigating novel protocols to save energy by reducing data traffic with the aid of optimal or heuristic algorithms. However, data packet behaviours and significant parameters involved are mostly preconfigured in a supervised-learning fashion rather than using an unsupervised learning paradigm and therefore may not adapt to uncertain or fast-changing environments. Hence, this paper concentrates on optimising the behaviours of data packets and significant parameters in a widely tested routing protocol, namely, Cognitive Packet Network (CPN), with the aid of several bio-inspired algorithms to increase the efficiency of energy usage and information acquisition. Two novel packet behaviours are introduced, and an on-line parameter calibration scheme is proposed to realise packet time-to-live (TTL) adjustment and rate adaptation. The simulation results show that the introduction of the bioinspired algorithms can improve the efficiency of information sharing and reduce the energy consumption.",none
How not to secure wireless sensor networks: a plethora of insecure polynomial-based key pre-distribution schemes,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1049/ise2.12016,none,ORIGINAL RESEARCH PAPER,Wiley,2021,"Three closely related polynomial-based group key pre-distribution schemes have recently been proposed, aimed specifically at wireless sensor networks. The schemes enable any subset of a predefined set of sensor nodes to establish a shared secret key without any communications overhead. It is claimed that these schemes are both secure and lightweight, that is, making them particularly appropriate for network scenarios where nodes have limited computational and storage capabilities. Further studies have built on these schemes, for example, to propose secure routing protocols for wireless sensor networks. Unfortunately, as shown by the author, all three schemes are completely insecure; whilst the details of their operation vary, they share common weaknesses. In two cases, we show that an attacker equipped with the information built into just one sensor node can compute all possible group keys, including those for which the attacked node is not a member; this breaks a fundamental design objective. In the other case, an attacker equipped with the information built into at most two sensor nodes can compute all possible group keys. In the latter case, the attack can also be achieved by an attacker armed with the information from a single node together with a single group key to which this sensor node is not entitled. Repairing the schemes appears difficult, if not impossible. The existence of major flaws is not surprising given the complete absence of any rigorous proofs of security for the proposed schemes. A further recent work proposes a group membership authentication and key establishment scheme based on one of the three key pre-distribution schemes analysed here; as the author demonstrates, this scheme is also insecure, as the attack we describe on the corresponding pre-distribution scheme enables the authentication process to be compromised.",none
A novel approach for void avoidance in wireless sensor networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dac.1079,9,Research Article,Wiley,2010,"We propose a novel approach to treat the problem of void avoidance in sensor networks. In our approach, the choice of the forwarding region around a discovered void is oriented by the locations of (i) the sender node, (ii) the void center and (iii) the destination node. Three void-avoidance schemes are described which use the same void-discovery algorithm. Based on an oriented face routing, the first scheme is used by the boundary nodes to prevent packets from dropping. The second scheme is used by sender nodes located n-hops away from the void boundary to launch a preventive rerouting. The third scheme tends to protect packets from both the concave zones and the boundaries nodes of voids. Proposed schemes are simple to implement. They save network resources and could be easily associated with existing geographic routing protocols. Simulation results show the efficiency of the proposed approach.

QoS-Oriented Optimal Relay Selection in Cognitive Radio Networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2021/5580963,4,Research Article,Wiley,2021,"A cognitive radio network can be employed in any wireless communication systems, including military communications, public safety, emergency networks, aeronautical communications, and wireless-based Internet of Things, to enhance spectral efficiency. The performance of a cognitive radio network (CRN) can be enhanced through the use of cooperative relays with buffers; however, this incurs additional delays which can be reduced by using virtual duplex relaying that requires selection of a suitable relay pair. In a virtual duplex mode, we mimic full-duplex links by using simultaneous two half-duplex links, one transmitting and the other one receiving, in such a way that the overall effect of duplex mode is achieved. The relays are generally selected based on signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). However, other factors such as power consumption and buffer capacity can also have a significant impact on relay selection. In this work, a multiobjective relay selection scheme is proposed that simultaneously takes into account throughput, delay performance, battery power, and buffer status (i.e., both occupied and available) at the relay nodes while maintaining the required SINR. The proposed scheme involves the formulation of four objective functions to, respectively, maximize throughput and buffer space availability while minimizing the delay and battery power consumption. The weighted sum approach is then used to combine these objective functions to form the multiobjective optimization problem and an optimal solution is obtained. The assignments of weights to objectives have been done using the rank sum (RS) method, and several quality-of-service (QoS) profiles have been considered by varying the assignment of weights. The results gathered through simulations demonstrate that the proposed scheme efficiently determines the optimal solution for each application scenario and selects the best relay for the respective QoS profile. The results are further verified by using the genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) techniques. Both techniques gave identical solutions, thus validating our claim.",none

So, sensor nodes are forced to operate at expensive full rate transmission power level continuously during whole network operation. These challenging network environments experience unwanted phenomena of drastic energy consumption and packet drop. In this paper, we propose an adaptive immune Multihopping Multilevel Clustering (MHMLC) protocol that executes a Hybrid Clustering Algorithm (HCA) to perform optimal centralized selection of Cluster-Heads (CHs) within radius of centrally located Base Station (BS) and distributed CHs selection in the rest of network area. HCA of MHMLC also produces optimal intermediate CHs for intercluster multihop communications that develop heterogeneity-aware economical links. This hybrid cluster-formation facilitates the sensors to function at short range transmission power level that enhances link quality and avoids packet drop. The simulation environments produce fair comparison among proposed MHMLC and existing state-of-the-art routing protocols.

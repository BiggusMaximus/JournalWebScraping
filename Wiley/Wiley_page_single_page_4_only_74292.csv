"Climate-smart agriculture using intelligent techniques, blockchain and Internet of Things: Concepts, challenges, and opportunities",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ett.4607,3,SURVEY ARTICLE,Wiley,2022,"The Internet of Things (IoT) is an important technology that provides efficient and dependable solutions in a variety of domains, such as smart agriculture and climatic change. It integrates billions of smart devices that can communicate with one another and gives solutions to automatically maintain and monitor smart agricultural and environmental fields. The combination of IoT, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and blockchain technology will allow us to transform smart agriculture into the Internet of smart agriculture, providing greater control, management, and security in supply-chain networks. This paper presents an overview of the technologies in the domains of IoT, Climate-Smart Agriculture (CSA), AI, Machine Learning (ML), and blockchain. In addition, the paper presents several approaches for integrating IoT with CSA data analysis. Both AI and blockchain are adopted for efficient CSA systems. TheÂ paper is concerned with the combination of three recent technologies: IoT, ML, and blockchain to serve the CSA applications. The challenges and opportunities of combining these technologies to serve CSA are also discussed in the paper.",none
An approach for provisioning virtual sensors in sensor clouds,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/nem.2062,6,RESEARCH ARTICLE,Wiley,2019,"In sensor clouds environments, the provisioning process is a crucial task since it is responsible for selecting physical sensors that will be used to create virtual sensors. However, most works consider the allocation of all sensors within the region of interest, causing serious problems such as the wasting of energy consumption. The objective of this paper is to present ACxSIM, an automatic approach to the provisioning of virtual sensors. ACxSIM includes two algorithms: adaptive clustering algorithm based on similarity (ACASIM) and ant colony optimization for sensor selection based on similarity (ACOSIM). ACASIM first clusters the sensor nodes based on the similarity of its measurements (exploiting the temporal and spatial correlations between them), which may create clusters with nodes not physically close to each other. Therefore, in ACASIM, a cluster represents different geographical areas whose nodes have correlated measurements (according to a defined error threshold). Later, ACOSIM, based on ant colony optimization algorithm, creates virtual sensors by selecting only a subset of nodes from each cluster. In this way, the overall energy consumption of sensor nodes is reduced, prolonging the lifetime of the sensor cloud. Results from experiments in Intel Lab dataset show that the ACxSIM reduces energy consumption by 73.97%, providing a solution to be considered in sensor cloud scenarios.",none
Signaling game approach to improve the MAC protocol in the underwater wireless sensor networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dac.3971,8,RESEARCH ARTICLE,Wiley,2019,"Underwater sensor networks (UWSNs) are instructed for critical applications like military surveillance and underwater oil spills that conducted in a very massive three-dimensional (3-D) space that needs many underwater nodes (UNs) to cover the target area. Those UNs are not easy to recharge and cannot exploit solar power. MAC protocols deployed for UWSN ought to consider the energy efficiency, so as, to extend the network lifetime with total connectivity and significant throughput. Terrestrial MAC protocols could not be used for UWSN due to long and unpredictable propagation delay. Consequently, the development of a new MAC protocol for the harsh environment as underwater is a challenging task. In this study, we focus on the deployment of TDMA in UWSN for this, two schemes entitled TDMA slot sharing (TSS) and free time slots reallocation (FTSR) are proposed. Received data stored in the buffer waiting for processing and forwarding might lead to an unlimited data transfer latency those results in the buffer overflow. Otherwise, free time slots appearing during the communication process resulting from dead nodes increase uselessly sleep time for the rest of the nodes. Both schemes based on signaling game are proposed to overcome those problems, TSS is used to enable the slot sharing between UNs during the communication process to reduce the buffer overflow. FTSR scheme aims to increase the throughput of UNs by allowing the reuse of free time slots. Numerical results conducted in this work show good improvement in the network performance concerning throughput.",none

Offering a Demand-Based Charging Method Using the GBO Algorithm and Fuzzy Logic in the WRSN for Wireless Power Transfer by UAV,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2023/6326423,2,Research Article,Wiley,2023,"An extremely high number of geographically dispersed, energy-limited sensor nodes make up wireless sensor networks. One of the critical difficulties with these networks is their network lifetime. Wirelessly charging the sensors continuously is one technique to lengthen the network’s lifespan. In order to compensate for the sensor nodes’ energy through a wireless medium, a mobile charger (MC) is employed in wireless sensor networks (WRSN). Designing a charging scheme that best extends the network’s lifetime in such a situation is difficult. In this paper, a demand-based charging method using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is provided for wireless rechargeable sensor networks. In this regard, first, sensors are grouped according to their geographic position using the K-means clustering technique. Then, with the aid of a fuzzy logic system, these clusters are ranked in order of priority based on the parameters of the average percentage of battery life left in the sensor nodes’ batteries, the number of sensors, and critical sensors that must be charged, and the distance between each cluster’s center and the MC charging station. It then displays the positions of the UAV to choose the crucial sensor nodes using a routing algorithm based on the shortest and most vital path in each cluster. Notably, the gradient-based optimization (GBO) algorithm has been applied in this work for intracluster routing. A case study for a wireless rechargeable sensor network has been carried out in MATLAB to assess the performance of the suggested design. The outcomes of the simulation show that the suggested technique was successful in extending the network’s lifetime. Based on the simulation results, compared to the genetic algorithm, the proposed algorithm has been able to reduce total energy consumption, total distance during the tour, and total travel delay by 26%, 17.2%, and 25.4%, respectively.",none

[Retracted] Swarm Intelligence with Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System-Based Routing Protocol for Clustered Wireless Sensor Networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2022/7940895,7,Research Article,Wiley,2022,"Wireless sensor network (WSN) comprises numerous compact-sized sensor nodes which are linked to one another. Lifetime maximization of WSN is considered a challenging problem in the design of WSN since its energy-limited capacity of the inbuilt batteries exists in the sensor nodes. Earlier works have focused on the design of clustering and routing techniques to accomplish energy efficiency and thereby result in an increased lifetime of the network. The multihop route selection process can be treated as an NP-hard problem and can be solved by the use of computational intelligence techniques such as fuzzy logic and swarm intelligence (SI) algorithms. With this motivation, this article aims to focus on the design of swarm intelligence with an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system-based routing (SI-ANFISR) protocol for clustered WSN. The proposed SI-ANFISR technique aims to determine the cluster heads (CHs) and optimal routes for multihop communication in the network. To accomplish this, the SI-ANFISR technique primarily employs a weighted clustering algorithm to elect CHs and construct clusters. Besides, the SI-ANFISR technique involves the design of an ANFIS model for the selection process, which make use of three input parameters, namely, residual energy, node degree, and node history. In order to optimally adjust the membership function (MF) of the ANFIS model, the squirrel search algorithm (SSA) is utilized. None of the earlier works have used ANFIS with SSA for the routing process. The design of SSA to tune the MFs of the ANFIS model for optimal routing process in WSN shows the novelty of the study.

Collaborative duty cycling strategies in energy harvesting sensor networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mice.12522,11,ORIGINAL ARTICLE,Wiley,2019,"Energy harvesting wireless sensor networks are a promising solution for low cost, long lasting civil monitoring applications. But management of energy consumption is a critical concern to ensure these systems provide maximal utility. Many common civil applications of these networks are fundamentally concerned with detecting and analyzing infrequently occurring events. To conserve energy in these situations, a subset of nodes in the network can assume active duty, listening for events of interest, while the remaining nodes enter low power sleep mode to conserve battery. However, judicious planning of the sequence of active node assignments is needed to ensure that as many nodes as possible can be reached upon the detection of an event, and that the system maintains capability in times of low energy harvesting capabilities.

FQ-MEC: Fuzzy-Based Q-Learning Approach for Mobility-Aware Energy-Efficient Clustering in MANET,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2021/8874632,2,Research Article,Wiley,2021,"Different schemes have been proposed for increasing network lifetime in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) where nodes move uncertainly in any direction. Mobility awareness and energy efficiency are two inescapable optimization problems in such networks. Clustering is an important technique to improve scalability and network lifetime, as it relies on grouping mobile nodes into logical subgroups, called clusters, to facilitate network management. One of the challenging issues in this domain is to design a real-time routing protocol that efficiently prolongs the network lifetime in MANET. In this paper, a novel fuzzy-based Q-learning approach for mobility-aware energy-efficient clustering (FQMEC) is proposed that relies on deciding the behavioral pattern of the nodes based on their stability and residual energy. Also, Chebyshev’s inequality principle is applied to get node connectivity for load balancing by taking history from the monitoring phase to increase the learning accuracy. Extensive simulations are performed using the NS-2 network simulator, and the proposed scheme is compared with reinforcement learning (RL). The obtained results show the effectiveness of the proposed protocol regarding network lifetime, packet delivery ratio, average end-to-end delay, and energy consumption.",none
Traffic and Energy Aware Optimization for Congestion Control in Next Generation Wireless Sensor Networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2021/5575802,23,Research Article,Wiley,2021,"Congestion in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is an unavoidable issue in today’s scenario, where data traffic increased to its aggregated capacity of the channel. The consequence of this turns in to overflowing of the buffer at each receiving sensor nodes which ultimately drops the packets, reduces the packet delivery ratio, and degrades throughput of the network, since retransmission of every unacknowledged packet is not an optimized solution in terms of energy for resource-restricted sensor nodes. Routing is one of the most preferred approaches for minimizing the energy consumption of nodes and enhancing the throughput in WSNs, since the routing problem has been proved to be an NP-hard and it has been realized that a heuristic-based approach provides better performance than their traditional counterparts. To tackle all the mentioned issues, this paper proposes an efficient congestion avoidance approach using Huffman coding algorithm and ant colony optimization (ECA-HA) to improve the network performance. This approach is a combination of traffic-oriented and resource-oriented optimization. Specially, ant colony optimization has been employed to find multiple congestion-free alternate paths. The forward ant constructs multiple congestion-free paths from source to sink node, and backward ant ensures about the successful creation of paths moving from sink to source node, considering energy of the link, packet loss rate, and congestion level. Huffman coding considers the packet loss rate on different alternate paths discovered by ant colony optimization for selection of an optimal path. Finally, the simulation result presents that the proposed approach outperforms the state of the art approaches in terms of average energy consumption, delay, and throughput and packet delivery ratio.",none

Hybrid localization scheme using K-fold optimization with machine learning in WSN,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dac.5206,5,RESEARCH ARTICLE,Wiley,2022,"Node localization technology can identify and track nodes, making observing data more relevant; for example, information received at the sink node would be useless to the client if node localization data from the sensor region were not included. Localization is described as determining the location of unknown sensor nodes named destination nodes applying the recognized location of anchor nodes based on measurements such as time difference of occurrence, time of occurrence, angle of occurrence, triangulation, and maximum probability. The purpose of node localization is to assign coordinates points to all sensor nodes arbitrarily put in the monitoring region and have an unknown location. Localization of nodes is essential to account for the cause of events that help group sensor querying, routing, and network coverage. In this paper, data transmission among the nodes is done by comparing the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) value with the supervised learning value. If the RSSI value is less than the supervised learning value, the data transmission takes place; else, no transmission. This paper proposes a hybrid localization scheme that effectively uses K-fold optimization with supervised learning and gives good results for distance error and RSSI/energy efficiency.

Social sensing-based duty cycle management for monitoring rare events in wireless sensor networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1049/iet-wss.2013.0125,6,Research Articles,Wiley,2015,"This paper introduces a social sensing-based dynamic duty cycle management scheme, namely probabilistic duty cycle in sensor medium access control (PDC-SMAC) protocol, for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The objective of PDC-SMAC is to minimise energy consumption in monitoring ‘rare events’ by reducing the period of ‘ineffective sensing’. Ineffective sensing is defined as event monitoring or sensing, even if there is no event to monitor or sense. Existing schemes suffer from unnecessary energy consumption because of ineffective sensing. For example, the period and frequency of occurrence of an event in military applications is unpredictable, and sometimes the delay between two consecutive occurrences is very large. We exploit the social sensing behaviour of social networks for avoiding ineffective sensing by managing the duty cycle of a node in a sensor network. PDC-SMAC minimises the energy consumption of a WSN as the event monitoring overhead is accounted for by the social network. Simulation results show that PDC-SMAC consumes 37% less energy in an ideal environment and 15% less energy on overall performances as compared with the benchmark considered for comparison.

On that account, the conjunction of wireless body area networks (WBAN) and Internet of Things (IoT) for healthcare and medical diagnosis has become really important, and is accordingly one of the most popular and attractive areas of the Internet of Things (IoT). In such an IoT, a wireless body area network (WBAN) consists of a miniature sample of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) that can be either implanted in the human body or wearable. Nowadays, IoT has made healthcare evaluation possible. Instead of the patient being constantly hospitalized for treatment, the condition of the person is sent to the health centre by the IoMT over the Internet. IoT enables wireless communication between smart devices on one side and almost anything on the other.

Distributed Image Compression Architecture over Wireless Multimedia Sensor Networks,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2017/5471721,22,Research Article,Wiley,2017,"In a wireless multimedia sensor network (WMSN), the minimization of network energy consumption is a crucial task not just for scalar data but also for multimedia. In this network, a camera node (CN) captures images and transmits them to a base station (BS).

Transmitting an image requires a large amount of energy due to the image size and distance; however, SNs are resource constrained. Image compression is used to scale down image size; however, it is accompanied by a computational complexity trade-off. Moreover, direct image transmission to a BS requires more energy.

Toward Performant and Energy-Efficient Network Queries: A Parallel and Stateless Approach,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2023/6185758,none,Research Article,Wiley,2023,"In many edge computing applications (e.g., wireless sensor networks, WSNs) where nodes are mostly battery-powered, queries’ energy consumption, and response time are two of the most important metrics, representing the network’s sustainability and performance, respectively. Conventional techniques used to focus on only one of the two metrics and did not attempt to optimize both in a coordinated manner. This work aims to achieve both high sustainability and high performance of these queries at the same time. To that end, a new mechanism is proposed to construct the topology of a three-tier WSN. The proposed mechanism eliminates the conventional stateful routing tables and employs a stateless and efficient addressing scheme inspired by the Chinese remainder theorem (CRT). The CRT-based topology allows for query parallelism, an unprecedented feature in the WSNs. On top of the new topology encoded by CRT, a new protocol is designed to parallelly preprocess collected data on sensor nodes by effectively aggregating and deduplicating data in a cluster of neighborhood nodes. At the same time, the hibernating mechanism is proposed to prolong the network life cycle. Moreover, a new algorithm is devised to allow the queries and results to be transmitted through low-power and fault-tolerant paths using recursive elections over a subset of the entire power range. With all these new techniques taken together, the system presented in this work outperforms approximate algorithms from various perspectives: (i) the query response is improved by up to 21.6%; (ii) the energy consumption is reduced by up to 16.8%; and (iii) the reliability is increased by up to 18.3%.",none

Selection of Optimal Deployment and Routing Configurations in Underwater Acoustic Sensor Networks for Avoiding Energy Holes,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2019/3597304,3,Research Article,Wiley,2019,"Improving the energy efficiency of underwater acoustic sensor networks (UW-ASNs) is a crucial issue due to the reduced and nonrechargeable energy resource of the underwater sensor nodes. In this work, we address the energy sink hole problem in UW-ASNs while considering the unique and harsh characteristics of the underwater channel. Our goal is to determine the optimal deployment and routing settings that surmount the energy sink hole problem and hence maximize the network lifetime. We prove that sensors can evenly consume their initial battery power provided that first they adjust their transmission power when they transmit the route through traffic and second they are appropriately placed while deployed. Mainly, we propose a deployment scheme and the corresponding balanced routing strategy that lead to uniform energy consumption among all underwater sensors subject to a predefined reliability level at the sink. Specifically, we look for the optimal deployment settings especially in terms of nodes’ separation distances that help achieving uniform energy consumption in the network while satisfying the application requirement especially in terms of desired information reliability. Jointly, at the routing layer, we assume that each sensor is provided with the possibility of dynamically adjusting its transmission power up to a given number of levels N. To this goal, we mainly deal with two main cases: fixed and variable nodes separation distance. For the fixed case, we suppose that any two successive nodes in the network are equally spaced, and we strive for deriving the optimal distance as well as the optimal number of transmission power levels along with optimal load weight corresponding to every possible transmission power level for every sensor node. For the variable case, we deal with two subcases: first, we suppose that the distance separating successive nodes follows an arithmetic progression, and second, we assume that the distance separating successive nodes is following a geometric sequence. Note that for both cases, namely, fixed and variable, we succeed to determine the optimal distances separating successive nodes and the optimal number N of transmission power levels along with the corresponding optimal load weight that overcome the energy holes problem, and hence the network lifespan is maximized while respecting the desired reliability level.",none

From the perspective of the entire network, it is difficult for this network model to reflect communication entities’ distribution in real 3D space. Moreover, the research results of analyzing network performance using different routing schemes are limited, and the research work is insufficient. With formerly related studies different,we propose a cell-gridded network model that considers the actual environment with cells of the node aggregation degree, which follows Zipf’s law with exponent γ.

Additionally, a better delay-capacity trade-off performance is achieved. Finally, we discuss the influence of parameters such as the number of network nodes n, the number of network cells m, the redundancy r, and γ on the capacity and delay.

Two single-path routing algorithms, shortest-path distance algorithm and shortest-path hop algorithm, are considered for evaluating the communication reliability during the second step. Their performances in terms of ACR and energy consumptions are compared through an empirical analysis of several examples. Results show that WSNs using the shortest-path distance algorithm are more reliable than those using the shortest-path hop algorithm in most cases, but consume more energy for delivering the sensed data to the sink node. Different scenarios are also considered to evaluate the impact of node density, channel condition and different monitored areas on ACR of WSNs.",none
Certificate revocation schemes for providing secure QoS in MANETs,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpe.7524,none,RESEARCH ARTICLE,Wiley,2022,"Due to crucial exchange issues, security in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) is more complicated. It is vital to secure MANET exchanges to ensure the network's services development. In this research, the proposed model focuses on providing trust and certificate-based Malicious Node detection for mobile adhoc networks and improving certificate revocation based on cluster head. The cluster head is crucial in eliminating falsely accused nodes. The malicious node may be easily discovered and isolated from the network using the trusted value. If the trust value falls below the trust threshold value in a trust management, the node is identified as malicious, the certificate is canceled, and the node is isolated from the network. The TSQRS protocol's integration with the CRS scheme was the main emphasis of the suggested model. The proposed model also creates more stable clusters with the help of Trust manager. When compared to other current protocols and methodologies, the findings produced by the suggested approach for the TSQRS-CRS scheme improve performance and stability in the QoS of MANETs. Finally, certain parameters were used to run the simulation, which resulted in an improved Packet Delivery Ratio, Routing Overhead, and reduced Delay.",none
An Optimized and Energy-Efficient Ad-Hoc On-Demand Distance Vector Routing Protocol Based on Dynamic Forwarding Probability (AODVI),https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2022/5750767,none,Research Article,Wiley,2022,"MANET (mobile ad-hoc network) is a wireless ad-hoc network made up of mobile devices that use peer-to-peer routing to provide network access instead of using a preexisting network infrastructure. Despite the network infrastructure’s simplicity, it faces issues such as changeable connection capacity, dynamic topology, node battery power exhaustion, and inadequate physical security. Broadcasting is a standard MANET approach for sending messages from a source node to all other nodes in the network. Flooding is a frequent method for broadcasting route request (RREQ) packets, which is susceptible to broadcast storms. The high retransmission rate is caused by the standard flooding technique, which causes media congestion and packet collisions, which can drastically reduce throughput and network performance. In a mobile ad-hoc network, efficient broadcasting focuses on selecting a compact forward node set while assuring broadcast coverage. The goal is to find a limited number of forward nodes that will provide complete coverage. In this paper, we propose an optimized and energy-efficient routing protocol for MANET (mobile ad-hoc network) based on dynamic forwarding probability in general and AODV (ad hoc on-demand distance vector) in particular, in which the route request packets are randomly controlled to increase the network lifetime and reduce packet loss in the flooding algorithm. We tested and assessed the results of our proposed solution using various network performance factors after implementing and integrating it into NS-2. According to simulation findings, our proposed technique effectively reduced route request propagation messages (RREQ). The suggested technique is more efficient, has a longer network lifetime, and uniformly utilizes node residual energy, enhancing network throughput and minimizing routing overhead when compared to regular and modified AODV protocols.",none

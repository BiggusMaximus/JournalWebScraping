0,RL-based routing in biomedical mobile wireless sensor networks using trust and reputation,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6328422/,9,Conference Paper,IEEE,2012,"The main function of biomedical sensor network is to guarantee that the data packets from patients can be delivered reliably to the destination node or medical center. Attached to patients, these nodes can be mobile, thus forming a mobile wireless sensor network (mWSN). Moreover, non-cooperative nodes may also be present in the network. This paper therefore proposes a routing method for non-cooperative mWSNs based on Reinforcement Learning (RL). In particular, a reputation and trust scheme to avoid misbehaving nodes was integrated with an existing RL-based routing protocol called RL-QRP. We evaluated its performance in non-cooperative mWSNs under various conditions of non-cooperation and mobility. We found that the proposed method can achieve a success ratio of up to 11% over the RL-QRP, and 25% over a non-learning brute force search threshold method.","Sensor Networks ,  Wireless Sensor ,  Wireless Sensor Networks ,  Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks ,  RL-based Routing ,  Data Packets ,  Destination Node ,  Mobile Sensors ,  Success Ratio ,  Biomedical Sensors ,  Shortest Path ,  Neighboring Nodes ,  Reward Function ,  Secret Sharing ,  Routing Algorithm ,  Routing Scheme ,  Trust Value ,  Mobile Nodes ,  Sink Node ,  Malicious Nodes ,  Number Of Sensor Nodes ,  Packet Forwarding ,  Packet Drop ,  Trust Mechanism "
1,Applying Graph Neural Network in Deep Reinforcement Learning to Optimize Wireless Network Routing,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9816354/,3,Conference Paper,IEEE,2022,"At present, the traffic in wireless sensor networks (WSN) is growing at an extremely fast speed, consuming more and more network resources. This undoubtedly affects the transmission performance of WSN. Good and efficient routing technology is one of the key technologies to solve this problem. Limited by the dynamic network state, traditional routing technology faces some problems such as performance degradation and lack of learning ability. In contrast, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), which has the ability of decision-making and online learning, has a better effect in facing the routing optimization problem. DRL can learn routing strategy online or offline through reinforcement learning mechanism and deep neural network. However, the existing routing models based on DRL use fully connected neural networks or convolutional neural networks, and cannot learn the network topology information. This will lead to the failure of the previously trained routing model in the face of a new network. Therefore, under the background that WSN nodes may fail, resulting in topology changes, this paper combines Graph Neural Network (GNN) with DRL, and proposes GRL-NET intelligent routing algorithm. The algorithm uses GNN instead of conventional neural network to construct DRL Agent. With the help of GNN, GRL-NET can not only learn the complex relationship among network topology, traffic and routing from the perspective of network topology, but also run in a network topology that has never appeared before. In order to evaluate the effect of GRL-NET, several groups of experiments were conducted under different traffic intensity. Experimental results show that GRL-NET can not only learn the best routing strategy, but also keep good results in the never-seen network topology.","Neural Network ,  Deep Learning ,  Wireless Networks ,  Deep Reinforcement Learning ,  Graph Neural Networks ,  Network Routing ,  Convolutional Neural Network ,  Deep Neural Network ,  Network Topology ,  Online Learning ,  Network State ,  Pathfinding ,  Intelligence Algorithms ,  Topological Changes ,  Wireless Sensor Networks ,  Topological Information ,  Traditional Routes ,  Face Model ,  Routing Algorithm ,  Routing Scheme ,  Actor Network ,  Sink Node ,  Source Node ,  Node Features ,  Graph Structure ,  Cause Of This Phenomenon ,  Critic Network ,  Neighboring Nodes ,  Markov Decision Process ,  Network Input "

The importance of WSN is of huge diversity as it is used in military services, environmental services, medicine, agriculture, etc. WSN is a composition of many sensor nodes that work together to send data from the source to the base station. The sensor nodes are placed systematically inside a network. The design of this network is of most importance as it deals with the reliability, efficiency, energy consumption, delay, and lifetime of the entire WSN. The longest lifespan of the system and lowering sensor node energy consumption are given top priority while developing a WSN. Various types of routing algorithms are used in the perspective of this.

To address the issues of slow convergence, high latency, and limited energy in existing intelligent routing protocols in UWSNs, a cross-layer opportunistic routing protocol (CLORP) for underwater sensor networks based on multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL) is proposed in this article. First, CLORP combines the decision-making capability of MARL with the idea of opportunistic routing to sequentially select a set of neighbors with larger values as potential forwarding nodes, thereby increasing the packet transmission success rate. Second, in the design of the MARL reward function, two reward functions for successful and unsuccessful packet transmission are designed jointly with cross-layer information to improve the routing protocolâ€™s performance.

5,Design of energy-aware QoS routing protocol in wireless sensor networks using reinforcement learning,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6900988/,5,Conference Paper,IEEE,2014,"Nowadays a major class of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) applications require a minimum quality of service parameters to be satisfied while the wireless sensor nodes are mobile. Most of the standard WSN routing protocols greedily choose the neighbor node with the best quality of service (QoS) parameter(s) as a next hop. However, the data packet might be able to be routed through other neighbors as it might require less QoS. So the energy of the neighbor node with the best QoS will deplete earlier than other nodes which will result in the reduction of network lifetime.

However, the lack of up-to-date training data, slow convergence, and low robustness due to the dynamic change of the network topology, makes these AI-based routing systems inefficient.

In this paper, we present a novel approach combining Federated Learning (FL) with Deep Reinforcement Learning (D RL) in order to ensure an effective network routing in wireless environment. First, we formalize the problem of network routing as a problem of RL, where multiple agents that are geographically distributed train the policy model in a fully distributed manner.

The major concern in WSN is energy consumption by each node and the way of communication between the nodes in the form delivery ration and the reliability need to be more concentrated. This paper presents an enhanced routing method to resolve the two interrelated issues of large-scale IoT-based WSNs.Â Systems that address clustering and routing independently do not function well together, leading to inefficient solutions when considering energy usage and network longevity. There are several cluster-based routing algorithms for usage with homogeneous WSNs, but very few cater to heterogeneous WSNs regarding energy efficiency.

In this paper, we develop a distributed routing strategy based on deep reinforcement learning that generalizes to diverse traffic patterns, congestion levels, network connectivity, and link dynamics. We make the following key innovations in our design: (i) the use of relational features as inputs to the deep neural network approximating the decision space, which enables our algorithm to generalize to diverse network conditions, (ii) the use of packet-centric decisions to transform the routing problem into an episodic task by viewing packets, rather than wireless devices, as reinforcement learning agents, which provides a natural way to propagate and model rewards accurately during learning, and (iii) the use of extended-time actions to model the time spent by a packet waiting in a queue, which reduces the amount of training data needed and allows the learning algorithm to converge more quickly. We evaluate our routing algorithm using a packet-level simulator and show that the policy our algorithm learns during training is able to generalize to larger and more congested networks, different topologies, and diverse link dynamics.

Routers can make the decision to route packets along with the network paths. An innovative routing system for Flying AdHoc Network(FANET) is provided by an enhanced form of AntHocNet. Dynamic routing protocols are more efficient in medium and large networks because they require most of the computing power, which is why smaller networks rely on the static routing protocol. In this study, routing algorithms, dynamic routing networks, Unmanned Aerial Vehicle(UAV) protocol, Routing Protocol(RPL) in the security of networks, and Flying Ad hoc networks are discussed.","Dynamic Routing ,  Static Routing ,  Dynamic Routing Protocol ,  Unmanned Aerial Vehicles ,  Wireless Technologies ,  Network Devices ,  Internet Protocol ,  Ad Hoc Networks ,  Network Routing ,  Routing Algorithm ,  Neural Network ,  Internet Of Things ,  Recurrent Neural Network ,  Wireless Networks ,  Access Control ,  Recommender Systems ,  Mobile Services ,  Wireless Sensor Networks ,  Denial Of Service ,  Cyber-physical Systems ,  Distributed Denial Of Service ,  Neural Architecture Search ,  Routing Table ,  Sybil Attack ,  Malicious Activities ,  Malicious Attacks ,  Routing Information ,  Mobile Nodes "

Aiming to the problem of void region in UWSNs, this article proposes a reinforcement learning-based opportunistic routing protocol (DROR). By considering the limited energy and underwater environment, DROR is a receiver-based routing protocol, and combines reinforcement learning (RL) with opportunistic routing (OR) to ensure real-time performance of data transmission as well as energy efficiency. To achieve reliable transmission when encountering void regions, a void recovery mechanism is designed to enable packets to bypass void nodes and continue forwarding. Furthermore, a relative

21,Multiagent Meta-Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Multipath Routing Optimization,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9410247/,20,Journal Article,IEEE,2022,"In this article, we investigate the routing problem of packet networks through multiagent reinforcement learning (RL), which is a very challenging topic in distributed and autonomous networked systems. In specific, the routing problem is modeled as a networked multiagent partially observable Markov decision process (MDP). Since the MDP of a network node is not only affected by its neighboring nodesâ€™ policies but also the network traffic demand, it becomes a multitask learning problem. Inspired by recent success of RL and metalearning, we propose two novel model-free multiagent RL algorithms, named multiagent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) and multiagent metaproximal policy optimization (meta-MAPPO), to optimize the network performances under fixed and time-varying traffic demand, respectively. A practicable distributed implementation framework is designed based on the separability of exploration and exploitation in training MAPPO. Compared with the existing routing optimization policies, our simulation results demonstrate the excellent performances of the proposed algorithms.","Pathfinding ,  Adaptive Routing ,  Multipath Routing ,  Meta Reinforcement Learning ,  Optimal Policy ,  Neighboring Nodes ,  Markov Decision Process ,  Reinforcement Learning Algorithm ,  Routing Problem ,  Traffic Demand ,  Model-free Reinforcement Learning ,  Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning ,  Proximal Policy Optimization ,  Time Step ,  Value Function ,  Reward Function ,  Noisy Environments ,  Information For Decision-making ,  Wireless Sensor Networks ,  Ideal Environment ,  Routing Scheme ,  Delivery Delay ,  Distribution Routes ,  Policy Gradient Method ,  Routing Algorithm ,  Critic Network ,  Multi-hop Networks ,  Policy Gradient Algorithm ,  Exploration Phase ,  Edge Server "

In this paper, an energy-efficient control and routing protocol for wireless sensor networks is presented. This algorithm is based on reinforcement learning for energy management in the network. This protocol seeks to optimize routing policies to maximize the long-term reward received by each node, using reinforcement learning, which is a machine learning approach. In order to improve the lifetime of wireless sensor network, three energy management approaches have been proposed. The first approach is to navigate correctly using reinforcement learning to reduce the length of the routes and to improve energy consumption. The second approach is to exploit a sleep scheduling technique to improve node energy consumption. The last approach is used to restrict data transmission of each node based on the received data change rate. Simulation results show that in terms of network lifespan, the proposed method significantly outperforms previous reported methods.","Energy Efficiency ,  Sensor Networks ,  Control Protocol ,  Wireless Sensor Networks ,  Energy-efficient Control ,  Energy Efficient Protocol ,  Energy Consumption ,  Simulation Results ,  Machine Learning Approaches ,  Data Transmission ,  Wireless Networks ,  Energy Management ,  Network Management ,  Sleep Schedule ,  Network Lifetime ,  Energy Of Nodes ,  Changes In Data ,  Optimal Policy ,  Node Status ,  Neighboring Nodes ,  Routing Method ,  Cluster Head ,  Data Fusion ,  Sink Node ,  Network Routing ,  Reward Function ,  Current Node ,  Percentage Of Nodes ,  Nodes In Order ,  Processing Routes "
23,A Comprehensive Research on Deep Learning Based Routing Optimization Algorithms in Software Defined Networks,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10392911/,0,Conference Paper,IEEE,2023,"Discovering an optimal routing in Software Defined Networks (SDNs) is challenging due to several factors like scalability issues, interoperability, reliability, poor configuration of controllers and security measures. The compromised SDN controller attacks at the control plane layer, packet losses in the topology and end-to-end delay are the most security risk factors in SDNs. To overcome this, in most of the existing researches, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm with various optimization techniques was implemented for optimal routing in SDN by providing link weights to balance the end-to-end delay and packet losses. DRL used Deterministic Policy Gradient (DPG) method which acts as an actor-critic reinforcement learning agent that searches for an optimal policy to minimize the expected cumulative long-term reward. However, discovering an optimal routing with efficient security measures is still a major challenge in SDNs. This research proposes a detailed review of routing optimization algorithms in SDN using Deep Learning (DL) methods which supports the researchers in accomplishing a better solution for future research.","Deep Learning ,  Pathfinding ,  Deep Reinforcement Learning ,  Packet Loss ,  Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm ,  Deterministic Policy Gradient ,  Control Plane ,  Deep Learning Models ,  Cloud Computing ,  Flow Data ,  Literature Survey ,  Generalization Capability ,  Optimal Feature ,  Network Resources ,  Optimal Path ,  Wireless Sensor Networks ,  Network Management ,  Load Balancing ,  Graph Neural Networks ,  Kinds Of Applications ,  Intrusion Detection System ,  Kernel Principal Component Analysis ,  Routing Scheme ,  Routing Method ,  Routing Algorithm ,  Intrusion Detection ,  Network Routing ,  Network Topology "
24,Distributed Cooperative Reinforcement Learning for Wireless Sensor Network Routing,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9771591/,4,Conference Paper,IEEE,2022,"In this work we examine a specific case of wireless sensor networks (WSN) we call peer-to-peer WSN where source and destination are both dynamic and each is subject to constraints of low bandwidth, limited energy storage, and limited computational resources. Peer-to-peer WSN require the consideration of data computation time as a limiting constraint on information availability unlike a standard WSN that can rely on the unconstrained sink to perform the necessary computation of the raw sensor data into usable information. To effectively manage and improve upon peer-to-peer WSN routing, and WSN routing in general, we present a deep reinforcement learning algorithm known as distributed cooperative reinforcement for routing (DCRL-R) which uses a neural network and expanded state space parameters to learn routing policies for WSN. DCRL-R also incorporates an increased action space for determining when and where to perform in-network computation of the raw sensor data. We perform tests of DCRL-R on a physical network utilizing measured node state parametric data and show its viability in future WSN applications compared to a baseline routing algorithm using shortest path decisions with no computational offloading.","Wireless Sensor Networks ,  Network Routing ,  Wireless Sensor Network Routing ,  Neural Network ,  State Space ,  Sensor Data ,  Shortest Path ,  Network State ,  Deep Reinforcement Learning ,  Reinforcement Learning Algorithm ,  Routing Algorithm ,  Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm ,  Computation Offloading ,  Decision-making Process ,  Learning Process ,  Internet Of Things ,  Input Layer ,  Global Status ,  Reward Function ,  Individual Nodes ,  Ad Hoc Networks ,  Network Discovery ,  Round-trip Time ,  Policy Learning ,  Actual Hardware ,  Deep Reinforcement Learning Model ,  Source Node ,  Distributed Algorithm ,  Notion Of State "
